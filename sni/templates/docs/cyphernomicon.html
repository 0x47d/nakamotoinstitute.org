        1.2. Foreword
    </h4>


    <ul>
        <li>
            - The Cypherpunks have existed since September, 1992. In that
   time, a vast amount has been written on cryptography, key
   escrow, Clipper, the Net, the Information Superhighway, cyber
   terrorists, and crypto anarchy. We have found ourselves (or
   _placed_ ourselves) at the center of the storm.
        </li>
        <li>
            - This FAQ may help to fill in some gaps about what we're
   about, what motivates us, and where we're going. And maybe
   some useful knowledge on crypto, remailers, anonymity,
   digital cash, and other interesting things.
        </li>

            + The Basic Issues
            <ul>

                    + Great Divide: privacy vs. compliance with laws
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            + free speech and privacy, even if means some criminals
       cannot be caught (a stand the U.S. Constitution was
       strongly in favor of, at one time)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    - a man's home is his castle...the essence of the Magna
         Carta systems...rights of the individual to be secure
         from random searches
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>
                                    - the legitimate needs to enforce laws, to respond to
         situations
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    - as seen in the gun debate
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - crypto = guns in the sense of being an individual's
         preemptive protection
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    + Transnationalism and Increased Degrees of Freedom
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - governments can't hope to control movements and
       communications of citizens; borders are transparent
                        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - This is not "the Official Cypherpunks FAQ." No such thing
     can exist. This is the FAQ I wanted written. Views
     expressed are my own, with as much input from others, as
     much consensus, as I can manage. If you want a radically
     different FAQ, write it yourself.  If you don't like this
     FAQ, don't read it. And tell your friends not to read it.
     But don't bog down my mailbox, or the 500 others on the
     list, with messages about how you would have worded Section
     12.4.7.2 slightly differently, or how Section 6.9.12 does
     not fully reflect your views. For obvious reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - All FAQs are the products of a primary author, sometimes of
     a committee. For this FAQ, I am the sole author. At least
     of the version you are reading now. Future versions may
     have more input from others, though this makes me nervous
     (I favor new authors writing their own stuff, or using
     hypertext links, rather than taking my basic writing and
     attaching their name to it--it is true that I include the
     quotes of many folks here, but I do so by explicitly
     quoting them in the chunk they wrote....it will be tough
     for later authors to clearly mark what Tim May wrote
     without excessively cluttering the text. The revisionist's
     dilemma.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The list has a lot of radical libertarians, some anarcho-
     capitalists, and even a few socialists
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Mostly computer-related folks, as might be expected. (There
     are some political scientists, classical scholars, etc.
     Even a few current or ex-lawyers.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Do I Speak for Others?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - As I said, no. But sometimes I make claims about what
       "most" list members believe, what "many" believe, or what
       "some" believe.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - "Most" is my best judgment of what the majority believe,
       at least the vocal majority in Cypherpunks discussions
       (at the physical meetings, parties, etc.) and on the
       List. "Many" means fewer, and "some" fewer still. "A few"
       will mean a distinct minority. Note that this is from the
       last 18 months of activity (so don't send in
       clarifications now to try to "sway the vote").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - In particular, some members may be quite uncomfortable
       being described as anarchists, crypto anarchists, money
       launderers, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - on nearly every point ever presented, some have disagreed
                </li>
                <li>
                    - feuds, battles, flames, idee fixes
                </li>
                <li>
                    - on issues ranging from gun control to Dolphin Encrypt to
     various pet theories held dearly
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Someone once made a mundane joke about pseudonyms being
     like multiple personality disorder--and a flame came back
     saying: "That's not funny. I am MPD and my SO is MPD.
     Please stop immediately!"
                </li>
                <li>
                    - can't be helped....can't present all sides to all arguments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - most on list are in U.S., and I am in U.S.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - NSA and crypto community is largely centered in the U.S.,
     with some strong European activities
                </li>
                <li>
                    - U.S. law is likely to influence overseas law
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Surveillance vs. Freedom
                </li>
                <li>
                    - nothing in the middle...either strong crypto and privacy is
     strongly limited, or the things I describe here will be
     done by some people....hence the "tipping factor" applies
     (point of no return, horses out of the barn)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Gary Jeffers, for example, devotes most of his "CEB" to
     issues surrounding PGP.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Clipper, LEAF, escrow, Denning, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - a myriad of encryption programs, bulk  ciphers, variants on
     PGP, etc. Some of these I've listed...others I've had to
     throw my hands over and just ignore. (Keeping track of
     zillions of versions for dozens of platforms...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - easy to get lost in the details, buried in the bullshit
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

                1.3.1. With so much material available, why another FAQ?
        </h5>

        <h5>
                1.3.2. No convenient access to archives of the list....and who could read 50 MB of stuff anyway?
        </h5>

        <h5>
                1.3.3. Why not Web? (Mosaic, Http, URL, etc.)
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Why not a navigable Web document?
                </li>
                <li>
                    - This is becoming trendy. Lots of URLs are included here, in
     fact. But making all documents into Web documents has
     downsides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Reasons why not:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - No easy access for me.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Many others also lack access. Text still rules.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Not at all clear that a collection of hundreds of
       fragments is useful
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - I like the structured editors available on my Mac
       (specifically, MORE, an outline editor)
                        </li>
                        <li>

        <h5>
                1.3.4. What the Essential Points Are
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - It's easy to lose track of what the core issues are, what
     the really important points are. In a FAQ like this, a vast
     amount of "cruft" is presented, that is, a vast amount of
     miscellaneous, tangential, and epiphenomenal material.
     Names of PGP versions, variants on steganograhy, and other
     such stuff, all of which will change over the next few
     months and years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + And yet that's partly what a FAQ is for. The key is just
     not to lose track of the key ideas. I've mentioned what I
     think are the important ideas many times. To wit:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - that many approaches to crypto exist
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - that governments essentially cannot stop most of these
       approaches, short of establishing a police state (and
       probably not even then)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - core issues of identity, authentication, pseudonyms,
       reputations, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Yes, reading this will point you toward other sources of
     information, will answer the most commonly asked questions,
     and will (hopefully) head off the reappearance of the same
     tired themes every few months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Use a search tool if you have one. Grep for the things that
     interest you, etc. The granularity of this FAQ does not
     lend itself to Web conversion, at least not with present
     tools.

                1.5.1. "Why is this FAQ not in Mosaic form?"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - because the author (tcmay, as of 7/94) does not have Mosaic
     access, and even if did, would not necessarily....
                </li>
                <li>
                    - linear text is still fine for some things...can be read on

     standard grep and similar tools

       things. Mini-essays, like most posts to Cypherpunks.

                                    - Cypherpunks are a bright group. A lot of clever things
         have been said in the 600 days x 40 posts/day = 24,000
         posts, and I am trying to use what I can.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    + Sadly, only a tiny fraction can be used
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            - because I simply cannot _read_  even a fraction of
           these posts over again (though I've only saved
           several thousand of the posts)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            - and because including too many of these posts would
           simply make the FAQ too long (it's still too long, I
           suppose)
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                1.5.3. Despite the length of this thing, a vast amount of stuff is missing. There have been hundreds of incisive analyses by Cypherpunks, dozens of survey articles on Clipper, and thousands of clever remarks. Alas, only a few of them here.
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - And with 25 or more books on the Internet, hundreds of FAQs
     and URLs, it's clear that we're all drowning in a sea of
     information about the Net.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Ironically, good old-fashioned books have a lot more

                1.5.4. Caveats on the completeness or accuracy of this FAQ
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + not all points are fully fleshed out...the outline nature
     means that nearly all points could be further added-to,
     subdivided, taxonomized, and generally fleshed-out with
     more points, counterpoints, examples
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - like a giant tree...branches, leaves, tangled hierarchies
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - views change, but don't get corrected in all places
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - different contexts lead to different viewpoints
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - simple failure by me to be fully consistent
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - and many points raised here would, if put into an essay
       for the Cypherpunks list, generate comments, rebuttals,
       debate, and even acrimony....I cannot expect to have all
       sides represented fully, especially as the issues are
       often murky, unresolved, in dispute, and generally
       controversial
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    - While I have done my best to ensure accuracy, errors will
     no doubt exist. And as anyone can see from reading the
     Cypherpunks list, nearly *any* statement made about any
     subject can produce a flurry of rebuttals, caveats,
     expansions, and whatnot. Some subjects, such as the nature
     of money, the role of Cypherpunks, and the role of
     reputations, produce dozens of differing opinions every
     time they come up!
                </li>
                <li>
                    - So, it is not likely that my points here will be any
     different. Fortunately, the sheer number of points here
     means that not every one of them will be disagreed with.
     But the math is pretty clear: if every reader finds even
     one thing to disagree with and then posts his rebuttal or
     elaboration....disaster! (Especially if some people can't
     trim quotes properly and end up including a big chunk of
     text.)

                        <li>
                            - If you disagree with my opinion, and you think you can
       change my mind, or cause me to include your opinion as an
       elaboration or as a dissenting view, then send it. If
       your point requires long debate or is a deep
       disagreement, then I doubt I have the time or energy to
       debate. If you want your views heard, write your own FAQ!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Ultimately, send what you want. But I of course will
       evaluate comments and apply a reputation-based filter to
       the traffic. Those who send me concise, well-reasoned
       corrections or clarifications are likelier to be listened
       to than those who barrage me with minor clarifications
       and elaborations.

                        <li>

       FAQ" is not what this is.

       on a particular topic--I just can't handle custom
       research. This FAQ is long enough, and the Glossary at
       the end contains additional information, so that I cannot
       expand upon these topics (unless there is a general
       debate on the list). In other words, don't assume this
       FAQ is an entry point into a larger data base I will
       generate. I hate to sound so blunt, but I've seen the
       requests that come in every time I write a fairly long
       article.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - newcomers to crypto should buy Bruce Schneier's "Applied
     Cryptography"...it will save many hours worth of
     unnecessary questions and clueless remarks about
     cryptography.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - the various FAQs publishe in the newsroups (like sci.crypt,
     alt.security.pgp) are very helpful. (also at rtfm.mit.edu)

     editing/searching tools to find the same topic in the main

     the main chapters than here in the MFAQ.

        2.3. "What's the 'Big Picture'?"
    </h4>


        <h5>
                2.3.1. Strong crypto is here. It is widely available.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                2.3.2. It implies many changes in the way the world works. Private channels between parties who have never met and who never will meet are possible. Totally anonymous, unlinkable, untraceable communications and exchanges are possible.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                2.3.3. Transactions can only be *voluntary*, since the parties are untraceable and unknown and can withdraw at any time. This has profound implications for the conventional approach of using the threat of force, directed against parties by governments or by others. In particular, threats of force will fail.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                2.3.4. What emerges from this is unclear, but I think it will be a form of anarcho-capitalist market system I call "crypto anarchy." (Voluntary communications only, with no third parties butting in.)

                2.4.2. "Why does the Cypherpunks list sometimes go down, or lose the subscription list?"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The host machine, toad.com, owned by John Gilmore, has had
     the usual problems such machines have: overloading,
     shortages of disk space, software upgrades, etc. Hugh
     Daniel has done an admirable job of keeping it in good
     shape, but problems do occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Think of it as warning that lists and communication systems
     remain somewhat fragile....a lesson for what is needed to
     make digital money more robust and trustable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - There is no paid staff, no hardware budget for
     improvements. The work done is strictly voluntarily.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Read for a while. Things will become clearer, themes will
     emerge, and certain questions will be answered. This is
     good advice for any group or list, and is especially so for
     a list with 500 or more people on it. (We hit 700+ at one
     point, then a couple of list outages knocked the number
     down a bit.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Read the references mentioned here, if you can. The
     sci.crypt FAQ should be read. And purchase Bruce Schneier's
     "Applied Cryptography" the first chance you get.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Join in on things that interest you, but don't make a fool
     of yourself. Reputations matter, and you may come to regret
     having come across as a tedious fool in your first weeks on
     the list. (If you're a tedious fool after the first few
     weeks, that may just be your nature, of course.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Avoid ranting and raving on unrelated topics, such as
     abortion (pro or con), guns (pro or con), etc. The  usual
     topics that usually generate a lot of heat and not much
     light. (Yes, most of us have strong views on these and
     other topics, and, yes, we sometimes let our views creep
     into discussions. There's no denying that certain
     resonances exist. I'm just urging caution.)

                <li>
                    - This is a natural reaction. Nobody can follow it all; I
     spend entirely too many hours a day reading the list, and I
     certainly can't follow it all. Pick areas of expertise and
     then follow them and ignore the rest. After all, not seeing
     things on the list can be no worse than not even being
     subscribed to the list!
                </li>

                <li>
                    - find someone who will digest it for you (Eric Hughes has
     repeatedly said anyone can retransmit the list this way;
     Hal Finney has offered an encrypted list)
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Better mailers may help. Some people have used mail-to-news
     systems and then read the list as a local newsgroup, with
     threads.

                        <li>
                            - I have Eudora, which supports off-line reading and

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - First, a lot of the stuff posted in the Usenet newsgroups,
     and on the Cypherpunks list, is peripheral stuff,
     epiphenomenal cruft that will blow away in the first strong
     breeze. Grungy details about PGP shells, about RSA
     encryption speeds, about NSA supercomputers. There's just
     no reason for people to worry about "weak IDEA keys" when
     so many more pressing matters exist. (Let the experts
     worry.) Little of this makes any real difference, just as
     little of the stuff in daily newspapers is memorable or
     deserves to be memorable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Second, "read the sources." Read "1984," "The Shockwave
     Rider," "Atlas Shrugged," "True Names." Read the Chaum
     article on making Big Brother obsolete (October 1985,
     "Communications of the ACM").
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Third, don't lose sight of the core values: privacy,
     technological solutions over legal solutions, avoiding
     taxation, bypassing laws, etc. (Not everyone will agree
     with all of these points.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Fourth, don't drown in the detail. Pick some areas of
     interest and follow _them_. You may not need to know the
     inner workings of DES or all the switches on PGP to make
     contributions in other areas. (In fact, you surely don't.)

                <li>
                    - Nobody. There's no formal "leadership." No ruler = no head
     = an arch = anarchy. (Look up the etymology of anarchy.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - However, the mailing list currently resides on a physical
     machine, and this machine creates some nexus of control,
     much like having a party at someon'e house. The list
     administrator is currently Eric Hughes (and has been since
     the beginning). He is helped by Hugh Daniel, who often does
     maintenance of the toad.com, and by John Gilmore, who owns
     the toad.com machine and account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - In an extreme situation of abuse or neverending ranting,
     these folks could kick someone off the list and block them
     from resubscribing via majordomo. (I presume they could--
     it's never happened.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - To emphasize: nobody's ever been kicked off the list, so
     far as I know. Not even Detweiler...he asked to be removed
     (when the list subscribes were done manually).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - As to who sets policy, there is no policy! No charter, no
     agenda, no action items. Just what people want to work on
     themselves. Which is all that can be expected. (Some people
     get frustrated at this lack of consensus, and they
     sometimes start flaming and ranting about "Cypherpunks
     never do anything," but this lack of consensus is to be
     expected. Nobody's being paid, nobody's got hiring and
     firing authority, so any work that gets done has to be
     voluntary. Some volunteer groups are more organized than we
     are, but there are other factors that make this more
     possible for them than it is for us. C'est la vie.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Those who get heard on the mailing list, or in the physical
     meetings, are those who write articles that people find
     interesting or who say things of note. Sounds fair to me.

                    - Maybe they already have been--several times. Many newcomers

     with little discussion of "the basics."
                </li>
                <li>
                    - This is hardly surprising....people get over the "basics"

     them) topics. All lists are like this.

                    - In any case, after you've read the list for a while--maybe
     several weeks--go ahead and ask away. Making your topic

                            - The 'cyberpunk' genre of science fiction often deals with
       issues of cyberspace and computer security ("ice"), so
       the link is natural.  A point of confusion is that
       cyberpunks are popularly thought of as, well, as "punks,"
       while many Cyberpunks are frequently libertarians and
       anarchists of various stripes. In my view, the two are
       not in conflict.

       Association." &lt;check this&gt; However, the advantages of the

     no more jump in and expect to be taken seriously without
     any preparation than in any other technical field.

                <li>
                    - Please don't. Ciphers require careful analysis, and should
     be in paper form (that is, presented in a detailed paper,
     with the necessary references to show that due diligence
     was done, the equations, tables, etc. The Net is a poor
     substitute.

                <li>
                    - Also, breaking a randomly presented cipher is by no means
     trivial, even if the cipher is eventually shown to be weak.
     Most people don't have the inclination to try to break a
     cipher unless there's some incentive, such as fame or money
     involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And new ciphers are notoriously hard to design. Experts are
     the best folks to do this. With all the stuff waiting to be
     done (described here), working on a new cipher is probably
     the least effective thing an amateur can do. (If you are
     not an amateur, and have broken other people's ciphers
     before, then you know who you are, and these comments don't
     apply. But I'll guess that fewer than a handful of folks on
     this list have the necessary background to do cipher
     design.)

     planning meetings, to building hardware, and to exploring
     DC-Nets. There's one for remailer operators, or there used
     to be. There are also lists devoted to similar topics as
     Cypherpunks, including Robin Hanson's "AltInst" list
     (Alternative Institutions), Nick Szabo's "libtech-l" list,
     the "IMP-Interest" (Internet Mercantile Protocols) list,

       they exist, and don't think to post to them. (This
       "forgetting" is one of the most interesting aspects of
       cyberspace; successful lists seem to be Schelling points

                            - "You pick two prime numbers; for example 5 and 7.
       Multiply them together, equals 35.  Now you calculate the
       product of one less than each number, plus one.  (5-1)(7-
       1)+1=21.  There is a mathematical relationship that says
       that x = x^21 mod 35 for any x from 0 to 34.  Now you
       factor 21, yeilds 3 and 7.
       
       "You pick one of those numbers to be your private key and
       the other one is your public key.  So you have:
       Public key: 3
       Private key: 7

                    + For conventional ciphers, including public key ciphers,

                        <li>
                            - Our universe presumably has some finite number of
       particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles).
       This leads to the "even if every particle were a Cray Y-
       MP it would take..." sorts of thought experiments.
       
       But I am considering _energy_ here. Ignoring reversible
       computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy
       (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper
       limit on how many basic computations could ever be done
       with the amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough
       calculation could be done by calculating the energy
       output of stars, stuff falling into black holes, etc.,
       and then assuming about kT per logical operation. This
       should be accurate to within a few orders of magnitude.)
       I haven't done this calculation, and won't here, but the
       result would likely be something along the lines of X
       joules of energy that could be harnessed for computation,
       resulting in Y basic primitive computational steps.
       
       I can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits,
       or whatever, that takes *more* than this number of steps
       to factor. Therefore, unbreakable in our universe.

        <h5>
                2.9.2. "How do remailers work?" (a vast number of postings have dealt with this)
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The best way to understand them is to "just do it," that
     is, send a few remailed message to yourself, to see how the
     syntax works. Instructions are widely available--some are
     cited here, and up to date instructions will appear in the
     usual Usenet groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The simple view: Text messages are placed in envelopes and
     sent to a site that has agreed to remail them based on the
     instructions it finds. Encryption is not necessary--though
     it is of course recommended. These "messages in bottles"
     are passed from site to site and ultimately to the intended
     final recipient.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The message is pure text, with instructions contained _in
     the text_ itself (this was a fortuitous choice of standard
     by Eric Hughes, in 1992, as it allowed chaining,
     independence from particular mail systems, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - A message will be something like this:
     
     ::
     Request-Remailing-To: remailer@bar.baz
     
     Body of text, etc., etc. (Which could be more remailing
     instructions, digital postage, etc.)
     
     
                </li>
                <li>
                    - These nested messages make no assumptions about the type of
     mailer being used, so long as it can handle straight ASCII
     text, which all mailers can of course. Each mail message
     then acts as a kind of "agent," carrying instructions on
     where it should be mailed next, and perhaps other things
     (like delays, padding, postage, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - It's very important to note that any given remailer cannot
     see the contents of the envelopes he is remailing, provided
     encryption is used. (The orginal sender picks a desired
     trajectory through the labyrinth of remailers, encrypts in
     the appropriate sequence (last is innermost, then next to
     last, etc.), and then the remailers sequentially decrypt
     the outer envelopes as they get them.  Envelopes within
     envelopes.)

                <li>
                    - With e-mail, people can screen their mail, use filters,
     ignore words they don't like, etc. Lots of options. "Sticks
     and stones" and all that stuff we learned in Kindergarten
     (well, I'm never sure what the the Gen Xers learned....).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Extortion is made somewhat easier by anonymous mailers, but
     extortion threats can be made in other ways, such as via
     physical mail, or from payphones, etc.
                </li>

     biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but

     raised about this, citing the dangers of having all
     identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key.
     Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting
     protocols that limit one's exposure, that limits the amount
     of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt
     protocols that require additional security, time delays,

                    - Some of us believe various forms of strong cryptography
     will cause the power of the state to decline, perhaps even
     collapse fairly abruptly. We believe the expansion into
     cyberspace, with secure communications, digital money,
     anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated
     interactions, will profoundly change the nature of
     economies and social interactions.
     
     Governments will have a hard time collecting taxes,
     regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations
     (small ones at least), and generally coercing folks when it
     can't even tell what _continent_ folks are on!

                    - A huge topic, one I've been thinking about since late 1987
     when it dawned on me that public key crypto and anonymous
     digital cash systems, information markets, etc. meant the
     end of governments as we know them. (I called this
     development "crypto anarchy." Not everyone is a fan of it.

     drops." Any message can be sent through an untraceable path
     with remailers....and then posted in encrypted form in a
     newsgroup readable in most countries, including the Former
     Soviet Union. This means the old stand by of the microfilm
     in a Coke can left by a certain tree on a rural road--a
     method fraught with delays, dangers, and hassles--is now
     passe. The same message can be send from the comfort of
     one's home securely and untraceably. Even with a a digital
     signature to prevent spoofing and disinformation. This spy
     can be a Lockheed worker on the Aurora program, a SIGINT
     officer at Woomera, or a disgruntled chip designer at
     Motorola.  (Yes, a countermeasure is to limit access to
     personal computers, to run only standard software that has
     no such crypto capability. Such embargoes may already apply
     to some in sensitive positions, and may someday be a

       in a world where any physical transmission can be traced
       to its origin, seems impossible. The solution presented
       here is unconditionally or cryptographically secure,
       depending on whether it is based on one-time-use keys or
       on public keys. respectively. It can be adapted to
       address efficiently a wide variety of practical
       considerations." ["The Dining Cryptographers Problem:
       Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability," David
       Chaum, Journal of Cryptology, I, 1, 1988.]

     hits, they can use an escrow service to insulate themselves
     from:</p>
     
     <ol>
     <li>From being traced, because the exchanges are handled via
     pseudonyms</li>
     
     <li>From the killer taking the money and then not performing
     the hit, because the escrow agent holds the money until the
     murder is verified (according to some prototocol, such a
     newspaper report...again, an area for more work,
     thankfully).</li>
     
     <li>From being arrested when the money is picked up, as this

     enamored, urging others to "do something!," and will then,
     when no interest is evidenced, become irate. To be more
     concrete, this happens most often with various and sundry
     proposals for "digital money." A close second is for
     various types of "Cypherpunks activism," with proposals
     that we get together and  collect a few million dollars to
     run Ross Perot-type advertisements urging people to use
     PGP, with calls for a "Cypherpunks radio show," and so on.

     09), it is inevitable that some FAQs will go unanswered
     when newbies (or others) ask them. Sometimes the FUQs are
     ignored because they're so stale, other times because to
     answer them is to continue and unfruitful thread.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + The same question is often asked about the Net in general.
     Lots of suggested reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - A list like Cypherpunks is going to have privacy and
       freedom advocates. Not all privacy advocates are
       libertarians (e.g., they may want laws restricting data
       collection), but many are. And libertarians naturally
       gravitate to causes like ours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Net grew anarchically, with little control. This appeals
       to free-wheeling types, used to making their own choices
       and building their own worlds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Libertarians are skeptical of central control structures,
       as are most computer programming types. They are
       skeptical that a centrally-run control system can
       coordinate the needs and desires of people. (They are of
       course more than just "skeptical" about this.)
                        </li>

     the alternatives...I don't think this is really so.)

     stories in "Wired" (issue 1.2, the cover story), and "Whole
     Earth Review" (Summer, 1993)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - a niche for a "renegade" and "monkey-wrenching" group, with

                    - Good question. The mailing list reached about 500
     subscribers a year or so ago and has remained relatively
     constant since then; many subscribers learned of the list
     and its address in the various articles that appeared.

                    - Informal organizations often level out in membership
     because no staff exists to publicize, recruit, etc. And
     size is limited because a larger group loses focus. So,
     some stasis is achieved. For us, it may be at the 400-700
     level. It seems unlikely that list membership would ever
     get into the tens of thousands.

       of public use of crypto. It brought crypto to the masses,
       or at least to the Net-aware masses. Second, the nearly
       simultaneous appearance of remailers (the Kleinpaste/Julf-
       style and the Cypherpunks "mix"-style) fit in well with
       the sudden awareness about PGP and crypto issues. And

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - There seem to be two main reasons people are drawn to
     Cypherpunks, besides the general attractiveness of a "cool"
     group such as ours. The first reason is _personal privacy_.
     That is, tools for ensuring privacy, protection from a
     surveillance society, and individual choice. This reason is
     widely popular, but is not always compelling (after all,
     why worry about personal privacy and then join a list that
     has been identified as a "subversive" group by the Feds?
     Something to think about.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The second major is personal liberty through reducing the
     power of governments to coerce and tax. Sort of a digital
     Galt's Gulch, as it were. Libertarians and
     anarchocapitalists are especially drawn to this vision, a
     vision which may bother conventional liberals (when they
     realize strong crypto means things counter to welfare,
     AFDC, antidiscrimination laws....).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - This second view is more controversial, but is, in my
     opinion, what really powers the list. While others may
     phrase it differently,  most of us realize we are on to
     something that will change--and already is changing--the
     nature of the balance of power between individuals and
     larger entities.

                    - Anarchy means "without a leader" (head). Much more common
     than people may think.
                </li>
                <li>

Anybody is free to do nearly anything, just not free to commit others to course of action, or control the machine resources the list now runs on, or claim to speak for the "Cypherpunks" as a group (and this last point is unenforceable except through reptutation and social repercussions).

        <h5>
                3.5.2. Another reason to be glad there is no formal Cypherpunks structure, ruling body, etc., is that there is then no direct target for lawsuits, ITAR vioalation charges, defamation or copyright infringement claims, etc.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Most of the list members are libertarians, or leaning in
     that direction, so the bias toward this is apparent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - (If there's a coherent _non_-libertarian ideology, that's
     also consistent with supporting strong crypto, I'm not sure
     it's been presented.)

        4.3. Why a Statement of Ideology?
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.3.1. This is perhaps a controversial area. So why include it? The main reason is to provide some grounding for the later comments on many issues.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                4.3.2. People should not expect a uniform ideology on this list. Some of us are anarcho-capitalist radicals (or "crypto anarchists"), others of us are staid Republicans, and still others are Wobblies and other assored leftists.

    <h4>
        4.4. "Welcome to Cypherpunks"
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.4.1. This is the message each new subscriber to the Cypherpunks lists gets, by Eric Hughes:
        </h5>

        <h5>
                4.4.2. "Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it. Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence. Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and couriers. Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions. "The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy. But to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it. "Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography. Cypherpunks wish to learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of it. Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures. Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to defend it. Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good cryptosystems. "Cypherpunks love to practice. They love to play with public key cryptography. They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail forwarding and delivery. They love to play with DC-nets. They love to play with secure communications of all kinds. "Cypherpunks write code. They know that someone has to write code to defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're going to write it. Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Cypherpunks realize that security is not built in a day and are patient with incremental progress. "Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed. Cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. "Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy." [Eric Hughes, 1993-07-21 version]

        4.5. "Cypherpunks Write Code"
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.5.1. "Cypherpunks write code" is almost our mantra.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                4.5.2. This has come to be a defining statement. Eric Hughes used it to mean that Cypherpunks place more importance in actually changing things, in actually getting working code out, than in merely talking about how things "ought" to be.
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Eric Hughes statement needed here:
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Karl Kleinpaste, author of one of the early anonymous
     posting services (Charcoal) said this about some proposal
     made: "If you've got serious plans for how to implement
     such a thing, please implement it at least skeletally and
     deploy it.  Proof by example, watching such a system in
     action, is far better than pontification about it."
     [Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu, news.admin.policy, 1994-06-30]
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                4.5.3. "The admonition, "Cypherpunks write code," should be taken metaphorically. I think "to write code" means to take unilateral effective action as an individual. That may mean writing actual code, but it could also mean dumpster diving at Mycrotronx and anonymously releasing the recovered information. It could also mean creating an offshore digital bank. Don't get too literal on us here. What is important is that Cypherpunks take personal responsibility for empowering themselves against threats to privacy." [Sandy Sandfort, 1994-07-08]
        </h5>

        <h5>
                4.5.4. A Cypherpunks outlook: taking the abstractions of academic conferences and making them concrete
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - One thing Eric Hughes and I discussed at length (for 3 days
     of nearly nonstop talk, in May, 1992) was the glacial rate
     of progress in converting the cryptographic primitive
     operations of the academic crypto conferences into actual,
     workable code. The basic RSA algorithm was by then barely
     available, more than 15 years after invention. (This was
     before PGP 2.0, and PGP 1.0 was barely available and was
     disappointing, with RSA Data Security's various products in
     limited niches.) All the neat stuff on digital cash, DC-
     Nets, bit commitment, olivioius transfer, digital mixes,
     and so on, was completely absent, in terms of avialable
     code or "crypto ICs" (to borrow Brad Cox's phrase). If it
     took 10-15 years for RSA to really appear in the real
     world, how long would it take some of the exciting stuff to
     get out?
                </li>
                <li>
                    - We thought it would be a neat idea to find ways to reify
     these things, to get actual running code. As it happened,
     PGP 2.0 appeared the week of our very first meeting, and
     both the Kleinpaste/Julf and Cypherpunks remailers were
     quick, if incomplete, implementations of David Chaum's 1981
     "digital mixes." (Right on schedule, 11 years later.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Sadly, most of the abstractions of cryptology remain
     residents of academic space, with no (available)
     implementations in the real world. (To be sure, I suspect
     many people have cobbled-together versions of many of these
     things, in C code, whatever. But their work is more like
     building sand castles, to be lost when they graduate or
     move on to other projects. This is of course not a problem
     unique to cryptology.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Today, various toolkits and libraries are under
     development. Henry Strickland (Strick) is working on a
     toolkit based on John Ousterhout's "TCL" system (for Unix),
     and of course RSADSI provides RSAREF. Pr0duct Cypher has
     "PGP Tools." Other projects are underway. (My own longterm
     interest here is in building objects which act as the
     cryptography papers would have them act...building block
     objects. For this, I'm looking at Smalltalk of some
     flavor.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - It is still the case that most of the modern crypto papers
     discuss theoretical abstractions that are _not even close_
     to being implemented as reusable, robust objects or
     routines. Closing the gap between theoretical papers and
     practical realization is a major Cypherpunk emphasis.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                4.5.5. Prototypes, even if fatally flawed, allow for evolutionary learning and improvement. Think of it as engineering in action.

    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.6.1. (more needed here....)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                4.6.2. As Sandy Sandfort notes, "The real point of Cypherpunks is that it's better to use strong crypto than weak crypto or no crypto at all. Our use of crypto doesn't have to be totally bullet proof to be of value. Let *them* worry about the technicalities while we make sure they have to work harder and pay more for our encrypted info than they would if it were in plaintext." [S.S. 1994-07-01]

    <h4>
        4.7. Free Speech Issues
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.7.1. Speech
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "Public speech is not a series of public speeches, but
     rather one's own
     words spoken openly and without shame....I desire a society
     where all may speak freely about whatever topic they will.
     I desire that all people might be able to choose to whom
     they wish to speak and to whom they do not wish to speak.
     I desire a society where all people may have an assurance
     that their words are directed only at those to whom they
     wish.  Therefore I oppose all efforts by governments to
     eavesdrop and to become unwanted listeners." [Eric Hughes,
     1994-02-22]
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "The government has no right to restrict my use of
     cryptography in any way.  They may not forbid me to use
     whatever ciphers I may like, nor may they require me to use
     any that I do not like." [Eric Hughes, 1993-06-01]
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                4.7.2. "Should there be _any_ limits whatsoever on a person's use of cryptography?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - No. Using the mathematics of cryptography is merely the
     manipulation of symbols. No crime is involved, ipso facto.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Also, as Eric Hughes has pointed out, this is another of
     those questions where the normative "should" or "shouldn't"
     invokes "the policeman inside." A better way to look at is
     to see what steps people can take to make any question of
     "should" this be allowed just moot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The "crimes" are actual physical acts like murder and
     kidnapping. The fact that crypto may be used by plotters
     and planners, thus making detection more difficult, is in
     no way different from the possibility that plotters may
     speak in an unusual language to each other (ciphers), or
     meet in a private home (security), or speak in a soft voice
     when in public (steganography). None of these things should
     be illegal, and *none of them would be enforceable* except
     in the most rigid of police states (and probably not even
     there).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Crypto is thoughtcrime" is the effect of restricting
     cryptography use.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                4.7.3. Democracy and censorship
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Does a community have the right to decide what newsgroups
     or magazines it allows in its community? Does a nation have
     the right to do the same? (Tennessee, Iraq, Iran, France.
     Utah?)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - This is what bypasses with crypto are all about: taking
     these majoritarian morality decisions out of the hands of
     the bluenoses. Direct action to secure freedoms.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h4>
        4.8. Privacy Issues
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.8.1. "Is there an agenda here beyond just ensuring privacy?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Definitely! I think I can safely say that for nearly all
     political persuasions on the Cypherpunks list. Left, right,
     libertarian, or anarchist, there's much more to to strong
     crypto than simple privacy. Privacy qua privacy is fairly
     uninteresting. If all one wants is privacy, one can simply
     keep to one's self, stay off high-visibility lists like
     this, and generally stay out of trouble.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Many of us see strong crypto as the key enabling technology
     for a new economic and social system, a system which will
     develop as cyberspace becomes more important. A system
     which dispenses with national boundaries, which is based on
     voluntary (even if anonymous) free trade. At issue is the
     end of governments as we know them today. (Look at
     interactions on the Net--on this list, for example--and
     you'll see many so-called nationalities, voluntary
     interaction, and the almost complete absence of any "laws."
     Aside from their being almost no rules per se for the
     Cypherpunks list, there are essentially no national laws
     that are invokable in any way. This is a fast-growing
     trend.)

                        <li>
                            - Privacy. If maintaining privacy is the main goal, there's
       not much more to say. Keep a low profile, protect data,
       avoid giving out personal information, limit the number
       of bank loans and credit applications, pay cash often,
       etc.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + There are two distinct (and perhaps simultaneously held)
     views that have long been found in the American psyche:

                        <li>
                            - "A man's home is his castle." "Mind your own business."
       The frontier and Calvinist sprit of keeping one's
       business to one's self.

       week by Yankelovich Partners, two-thirds said it was more
       important to protect the privacy of phone calls than to
       preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps. When

     evidence that you simply cannot trust the government with
     your own personal safety. Some people, given positions of
     power, will naturally abuse those positions, often even if
     such abuse could cause severe injury or death. I see little
     reason, therefore, to simply "trust" the U.S. government --
     and given that the U.S. government is about as good as they
     get, its obvious that NO government deserves the blind
     trust of its citizens. "Trust us, we will protect you"
     rings quite hollow in the face of historical evidence.
     Citizens must protect and preserve their own privacy -- the
     government and its centralized cryptographic schemes

                        <li>
                            - Someone is carrying drugs. He knows what he's involved
       in. He knows that theft is punishable by death. And yet
       he steals some of the merchandise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Dealers understand that they cannot tolerate this, that
       an example must be made, else all of their employees will
       steal.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - (A meta point: the drug laws makes things this way.
     Legalize all drugs and the businesses would be more like
     "ordinary" businesses.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - In my highly personal opinion, many people, including most
     Congressrodents, have committed crimes that earn them the
     death penalty; I will not be sorry to see anonymous
     assassination markets used to deal with them.
                </li>
            </ul>

                4.11.6. Increased espionage will help to destroy nation-state-empires like the U.S., which has gotten far too bloated and far too dependent on throwing its weight around; nuclear "terrorism" may knock out a few cities, but this may be a small price to pay to undermine totally the socialist welfare states that have launched so many wars this century.

        4.12. Loose Ends
    </h4>


        <h5>
                4.12.1. "Why take a "no compromise" stance?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Compromise often ends up in the death of a thousand cuts.
     Better to just take a rejectionist stance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The National Rifle Association (NRA) learned this lesson
     the hard way. EFF may eventually learn it; right now they
     appear to be in the "coopted by the power center" mode,
     luxuriating in their inside-the-Beltway access to the Veep,
     their flights on Air Force One, and their general
     schmoozing with the movers and shakers...getting along by
     going along.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Let's not compromise on basic issues. Treat censorship as a
     problem to be routed around (as John Gilmore suggests), not
     as something that needs to be compromised on. (This is
     directed at rumblings about how the Net needs to "police
     itself," by the "reasonable" censorship of offensive posts,
     by the "moderation" of newsgroups, etc. What should concern
     us is the accomodation of this view by well-meaning civil
     liberties groups, which are apparently willing to play a
     role in this "self-policing" system. No thanks.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - (And since people often misunderstand this point, I'm not
     saying private companies can't set whatever policies they
     wish, that moderated newsgroups can't be formed, etc.
     Private arrangements are just that. The issue is when
     censorship is forced on those who have no other
     obligations. Government usually does this, often aided and
     abetted by corporations and lobbying groups. This is what
     we need to fight. Fight by routing around, via technology.)
                </li>
            </ul>

                4.12.2. The inherent evils of democracy
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - To be blunt about it, I've come to despise the modern
     version of democracy we have. Every issue is framed in
     terms of popular sentiment, in terms of how the public
     would vote. Mob rule at its worst.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Should people be allowed to wear blue jeans? Put it to a
     vote. Can employers have a policy on blue jeans? Pass a
     law. Should health care be provided to all? Put it to a
     vote. And so on, whittling away basic freedoms and rights.
     A travesty. The tyranny of the majority.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - De Toqueville warned of this when he said that the American
     experiment in democracy would last only until citizens
     discovered they could pick the pockets of their neighbors
     at the ballot box.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - But maybe we can stop this nonsense. I support strong
     crypto (and its eventual form, crypto anarchy) because it
     undermines this form of democracy. It takes some (and
     perhaps many) transactions out of the realm of popularity
     contests, beyond the reach of will of the herd. (No, I am
     not arguing there will be a complete phase change. As the
     saying goes, "You can't eat cyberspace." But a lot of
     consulting, technical work, programming, etc., can in fact
     be done with crypto anarchic methods, with the money gained
     transferred in a variety of ways into the "real world."
     More on this elsewhere.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Crypto anarchy effectively allows people to pick and choose
     which laws they support, at least in cyberspatial contexts.
     It empowers people to break the local bonds of their
     majoritarian normative systems and decide for themselves
     which laws are moral and which are bullshit.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - I happen to have faith that most people will settle on a
       relatively small number of laws that they'll (mostly)
       support, a kind of Schelling point in legal space.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <h5>
                4.12.3. "Is the Cypherpunks agenda _too extreme_?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Bear in mind that most of the "Cypherpunks agenda," to the
     extent we can identify it, is likely to provoke ordinary
     citizens into _outrage_. Talk of anonymous mail, digital
     money, money laundering, information markets, data havens,
     undermining authority, transnationalism, and all the rest
     (insert your favorite idea) is not exactly mainstream.
                </li>

        <h5>
                4.12.4. "Crypto Anarchy sounds too wild for me."
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - I accept that many people will find the implications of
     crypto anarchy (which follows in turn from the existence of
     strong cryptography, via the Crypto Anarchy Principle) to
     be more than they can accept.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - This is OK (not that you need my OK!). The house of
     Cypherpunks has many rooms.

                <li>
                    - detailed crypto knowledge is not needed to understand many
     of the implications, but it helps to know the basics (it
     heads off many of the most wrong-headed interpretations)
                </li>
                <li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - A good question. I'll be keeping this section brief, as
     many textbooks can afford to do a much better job here than
     I can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - not just for those who read number theory books with one

        <h5>
                5.3.2. NOTE: This section may remain disorganized, at least as compared to some of the later sections. Many excellent sources on crypto exist, including readily available FAQs (sci.crypt, RSADSI FAQ) and books. Schneier's books is especially recommended, and should be on _every_ Cypherpunk's bookshelf.

                 stream.  First, you want exactly two copies of
                 the random stream.  CD ROM has an economic
                 advantage only for large runs. Second, you want
                 to destroy the part of the stream already used.
                 CD ROM has no erase facilities, outside of
                 physical destruction of the entire disk."

     transaction. But within the context of a transaction, yes.
     Additional safeguards/speedbumps can be inserted (such as
     biometric credentials, additional passphrases, etc.), but
     these are essentially part of the "key," so the basic
     answer remains "yes." (There are periodically concerns
     raised about this, citing the dangers of having all
     identity tied to a single credential, or number, or key.
     Well, there are ways to handle this, such as by adopting
     protocols that limit one's exposure, that limits the amount
     of money that can be withdrawn, etc. Or people can adopt
     protocols that require additional security, time delays,
     countersigning, etc.)

     many contracts and crypto transactions will be that
     possession of key = possession of identity. Even a court
     test may mean little, for the types of transactions I
     expect to see.

         waiting to be done (described here), working on a new

         are, and these comments don't apply. But I'll guess
         that fewer than a handful of folks on this list have
         the necessary background to do cipher design.)

     or not: "I can take a simple generator X[i] = DES( X[i-1],
     K ), which will produce nice random white noise, but you
     won't be able to see that it's non-random unless you rent
     time on NSA's DES-cracker." [B.S. 1994-09-06]

       "cryptoregular": they are regular, or nonrandom, as soon
       as one uses the right key. Obviously, most strings used
       in crypto are cryptoregular in that they _appear_ to be
       random, and pass various randomness measures, but are
       not.

         entropy for finite objects like a string or a (finite)
         series of random numbers is the so-called ``program
         length complexity''.  This is defined as the length of
         the shortest program for some given universal Turing
         machine
         which computes the string.  It's consistent in the
         sense that it has the familiar properties of
         ``ordinary'' (Shannon) entropy.  Unfortunately, it's
         uncomputable: there's no algorithm which, given an
         arbitrary finite string S, computes the program-length
         complexity of S.
         
         Program-length complexity is well-studied in the
         literature.  A good introductory paper is ``A Theory of
         Program Size Formally Identical to Information Theory''

       be said is that a number of string is the reuslt of a

       deterministically, we call this process "pseudo-random."

                    + This is a basic primitive operation of most digital cash
     systems. Any good textbook on crypto should explain it, and
     cover the math needed to unerstand it in detail. Several
     people have explained it (many times) on the list; here's a
     short explanation by Karl Barrus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "Conceptually, when you blind a message, nobody else can
       read it.  A property about blinding is that under the
       right circumstances if another party digitally signs a
       blinded message, the unblinded message will contain a
       valid digital signature.
       
       "So if Alice blinds the message "I owe Alice $1000" so
       that it reads (say) "a;dfafq)(*&amp;" or whatever, and Bob
       agrees to sign this message, later Alice can unblind the
       message Bob signed to retrieve the original.  And Bob's
       digital signature will appear on the original, although
       he didn't sign the original directly.
       
       "Mathematically, blinding a message means multiplying it
       by a number (think of the message as being a number).
       Unblinding is simply dividing the original blinding
       factor out." [Karl Barrus, 1993-08-24]

                            - "Chaum's "blinded credential" system is intended to solve
       exactly this kind of problem, but it requires an
       extensive infrastructure.  There has to be an agency
       where you physically identify yourself.  It doesn't have
       to know anything about you other than some physical ID
       like fingerprints.  You and it cooperate to create
       pseudonyms of various classes, for example, a "go to the
       doctor" pseudonym, and a "go to the pharmacy" pseudonym.
       These pseudonyms have a certain mathematical relationship
       which allows you to re-blind credentials written to one
       pseudonym to apply to any other.  But the agency uses
       your physical ID to make sure you only get one pseudonym
       of each kind....So, when the doctor gives you a
       prescription, that is a credential applied to your "go to
       the doctor" pseudonym.  (You can of course also reveal
       your real name to the doctor if you want.)  Then you show
       it at the pharmacy using your "go to the pharmacy"
       pseudonym.  The credential can only be shown on this one
       pseudonym at the pharamacy, but it is unlinkable to the
       one you got at the doctor's.  " [Hal Finney, 1994-09-07]

       readers who are not cryptologists get some flavor of the

       *exponentiations* and *modular arithmetic* (the "clock
       arithmetic" of our "new math" childhoods, except with
       really, really big numbers!). The difficulty of inverting
       the exponention (the discrete log problem) is what makes
       this a cryptographically interesting approach.

         the group of integers modulo p. Now, it turns out that
         given a known p, b, and (b^x) mod p, it's extremely
         hard to find out x.  That's known as the discrete log
         problem.
         
         "Here's how to use it.  Let two parties, X and Y, pick
         random numbers x and y, 1 &lt; x,y &lt; p.  They each

         (b^y) mod p, so s/he can calculate (b^y)^x mod p =
         (b^(xy)) mod p.  Y can do the same calculation.  Now
         they both know (b^(xy)) mod p.  But eavesdroppers know
         only (b^x) mod p and (b^y) mod p, and can't use those

         course, X and Y will use that shared secret as a key to

       matrices, Nash equilibria, etc. It seems likely to me
       that the concepts of crypto will be recast in terms of a
       smaller set of basic ideas taken from these disparate

     "computationally-secure," to some level of security
     dependent on modulus lenght, computer resources and time
     available, etc. Thus, given enough time and enough computer
     power, these ciphers are breakable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - However, they may be practically impossible to break, given
     the amount of energy in the universe.Not to split universes
     here, but it is interesting to consider that some ciphers
     may not be breakable in _our_ universe, in any amount of
     time. Our universe presumably has some finite number of
     particles (currently estimated to be 10^73 particles). This
     leads to the "even if every particle were a Cray Y-MP it
     would take..." sorts of thought experiments.
     
     But I am considering _energy_ here. Ignoring reversible
     computation for the moment, computations dissipate energy
     (some disagree with this point). There is some uppper limit
     on how many basic computations could ever be done with the
     amount of free energy in the universe. (A rough calculation
     could be done by calculating the energy output of stars,
     stuff falling into black holes, etc., and then assuming
     about kT per logical operation. This should be accurate to
     within a few orders of magnitude.) I haven't done this
     calculation, and won't today, but the result would likely
     be something along the lines of X joules of energy that
     could be harnessed for computation, resulting in Y basic
     primitive computational steps.
     
     I can then find a modulus of 3000 digits or 5000 digits, or
     whatever,that takes more than this number of steps to
     factor.
     
     Caveats:
     
     1. Maybe there are really shortcuts to factoring. Certainly
     improvements in factoring methods will continue. (But of
     course these improvements are not things that convert
     factoring into a less than exponential-in-length
     problem...that is, factoring appears to remain "hard.")
     
     2. Maybe reversible computations (a la Landauer, Bennett,
     et. al.) actually work. Maybe this means a "factoring
     machine" can be built which takes a fixed, or very slowly
     growing, amount of energy.
     
     3. Maybe the quantum-mechanical idea of Shore is possible.
     (I doubt it, for various reasons.)
     
     I continue to find it useful to think of very large numbers
     as creating "force fields" or "bobbles" (a la Vinge) around
     data. A 5000-decimal-digit modulus is as close to being
     unbreakable as anything we'll see in this universe.

       dangerous, in terms of forgetting. (And writing down a
       passphrase may be vastly more risky than a shorter but
       more easily memorized passphrase is.  I think theft
       of keys and keystroke capturing on compromised machines

                            - Another approach to getting enough entropy in
       passwords/phrases is a "visual key" where one mouses from
       position to position in a visual environment. That is,
       one is presented with a scene containg some number of
       nodes, perhaps representing familiar objects from one's
       own home, and a path is chosen.  The advantage is that
       most people can remember fairly complicated
       (read: high entropy) "stories." Each object triggers a
       memory of the next object to visit. (Example: door to
       kitchen to blender to refrigerator to ..... ) This is the
       visual memory system said to be favored by Greek epic
       poets. This also gets around the keyboard-monitoring
       trick (but not necessarily the CRT-reading trick, of
       course).
       
       
       It might be an interesting hack to offer this as a front
       end for PGP. Even a simple grid of characters which could
       be moused on could be an assist in using long
       passphrases.

    </h4>


        <h5>
                6.2.1. Main Points
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Strong crypto reclaims the power to decide for one's self,
     to deny the "Censor" the power to choose what one reads,
     watches, or listens to.

                    - this section is short, but is less focussed than other
     sections; it is essentially a "transition" chapter.

    <h4>
        6.3. General Uses of and Reasons for Crypto
    </h4>


        <h5>
                6.3.1. (see also the extensive listing of "Reasons for Anonymity," which makes many points about the need and uses for strong crypto)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                6.3.2. "Where is public key crypto really needed?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "It is the case that there is relatively little need for
     asymmetric key cryptography in small closed populations.
     For example, the banks get along quite well without.  The
     advantage of public key is that it permits private
     communication in a large and open population and with a
     minimum of prearrangement." [WHMurray, sci.crypt, 1994-08-
     25]
                </li>
                <li>
                    - That is, symmetric key systems (such as conventional
     ciphers, one time pads, etc.) work reasonably well by
     prearrangement between parties. And of course one time pads
     have the additional advantage of being information-
     theoretically secure. But asymmetric or public key methods
     are incredibly useful when: the parties have not met
     before, when key material has not been exchanged, and when
     concerns exist about storing the key material. The so-
     called "key management problem" when N people want to
     communicate pairwise with each other is well-founded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And of course public key crypto makes possible all the
     other useful stuff like digital money, DC-Nets, zero
     knowledge proofs, secret sharing, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>

                                    - Personally, I don't worry too much. But many people do.
         Encryption tools are widely available.

                                <li>
                                    - Cellular telephones are notoriously insecure, as are
         cordless phones (even less secure). There are laws
         about monitoring, small comfort as that may be. (And
         I'm largely opposed to such laws, for libertarian
         reasons and because it creates a false sense of
         security.)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - Laptops are probably less vulnerable to Van Eck types
         of RF monitoring than are CRTs. The trend to lower
         power, LCDs, etc., all works toward decreasing
         vulnerability. (However, computer power for extracting
         weak signals out of noise is increasing faster than RF
         are decreasing....tradeoffs are unclear.)
                                </li>

                        <li>
                            - that is, mail is misdelivered,via hosts incorrectly
       processing the addresses
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - encryption obviously prevents misunderstandings (though
       it does little to get the mail delivered correctly)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>

                                    - the various court cases about employers reading
         ostensibly private e-mail will sharpen this debate (and
         raise the issue of employers forbidding encryption;
         resonances with the mostly-settled issue of reasonable
         use of company phones for private calls-more efficient
         to let some personal calls be made than to lose the
         time of employees going to public phones)
                                </li>

                                    - also, tighter links between sender and receive, as
         opposed to the current "dial the number and hope it's
         the right one" approach, will encourage the additional
         use of encryption
                                </li>

       corporation-LANs, WANs, Novell, Ethernet, TCP-IP, Banyan,
       and so on-cannot all be checked for taps...who would even
       have the records to know if some particular wire is going
       where it should? (so many undocumented hookups, lost
       records, ad hoc connections, etc.)

                                    - the solution is to have point-to-point encryption, even
         withing corporations (for important items, at least)

        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - These moral questions pop up on the List once in a while,
     often asked by someone preparing to write a paper for a
     class on ethics or whatnot. Most of us on the list probably
     think the answers are clearly "yes," but many in the public
     may not think so. The old dichotomy between "None of your
     damned business" and "What have you got to hide?"
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Is it good that people can write diaried unread by
     others?" "Is it good that people can talk to each other
     without law enforcement knowing what they're saying?" "Is
     it good that people can lock their doors and hide from
     outsiders?" These are all essentially equivalent to the
     questions above.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Anonymity may not be either good or not good, but the
     _outlawing_ of anonymity would require a police state to
     enforce, would impinge on basic ideas about private
     transactions, and would foreclose many options that some
     degree of anonymity makes possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "People should not be anonymous" is a normative statement
     that is impractical to enforce.

            </ul>

        <h5>
                6.7.2. Speaking of the isolation from physical threats and pressures that cyberspace provides, Eric Hughes writes: "One of the whole points of anonymity and pseudonymity is to create immunity from these threats, which are all based upon the human body and its physical surroundings. What is the point of a system of anonymity which can be pierced when something "bad" happens? These systems do not reject the regime of violence; rather, they merely mitigate it slightly further and make their morality a bit more explicit.....I desire systems which do not require violence for their existence and stability. I desire anonymity as an ally to break the hold of morality over culture." [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-31]

With crypto anarchy we can painlessly, without initiation of aggression, dispose of the nonproductive, the halt and the lame. (Charity is always possible, but I suspect even the liberal do-gooders will throw up their hands at the prospect of a nation of mostly unskilled and essentially illiterate and innumerate workers being unable to get meaninful, well-paying jobs.)

     costs and pass them on...any bank which tried to save a few
     bucks in
     losses by requiring 10-digit PINs--which people would
     *write down*
     anyway!--would lose customers. Holograms and pictures on

        7.3. Introduction
    </h4>


        <h5>
                7.3.1. Why does PGP rate its own section?
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Like Clipper, PGP is too big a set of issues not to have
     its own section
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                7.3.2. "What's the fascination in Cypherpunks with PGP?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Ironically, our first meeting, in September 1992, coincided
     within a few days of the release of PGP 2.0. Arthur Abraham
     provided diskettes of 2.0, complete with laser-printed
     labels. Version 2.0 was the first truly useful version of
     PGP (so I hear....I never tried Version 1.0, which had
     limited distribution). So PGP and Cypherpunks shared a
     history--and Phil Zimmermann has been to some physical
     meetings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - A practical, usable, understandable tool. Fairly easy to
     use. In contrast, many other developments are more abstract
     and do not lend themselves to use by hobbyists and
     amateurs. This alone ensures PGP an honored place (and
     might be an object lesson for developers of other tools).
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                7.3.3. The points here focus on PGP, but may apply as well to similar crypto programs, such as commercial RSA packages (integrated into mailers, commercial programs, etc.).

    </h4>


        <h5>
                7.5.1. PGP 2.0 arrived at an important time
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - in September 1992, the very same week the Cypherpunks had
     their first meeting, in Oakland, CA. (Arthur Abraham
     printed up professional-looking diskette labels for the PGO
     2.0 diskettes distributed. A general feeling that we were
     forming at the "right time.")
                </li>
                <li>
                    - just 6 months before the Clipper announcement caused a
     firestorm of interest in public key cryptography
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                7.5.2. PGP has been the catalyst for major shifts in opinion
        </h5>

            <ul>

                    - has educated tens of thousands of users in the nature of
     strong crypto

                <li>
                    - has led to other tools, including encrypted remailers,
     experiments in digital money, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                7.5.3. "If this stuff is so important, how come not everyone is digitally signing their messages?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - (Me, for example. I never sign my messages, and this FAQ is
     not signed. Maybe I will, later.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - convenience, ease of use, "all crypto is economics"
                </li>
                <li>
                    - insecurity of host Unix machines (illusory)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - better integration with mailers needed
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                7.5.4. Ripem appears to be dead; traffic in alt.security.ripem is almost zero. PGP has obviously won the hearts and minds of the user community; and now that it's "legal"...

                            - "PGP 2.6 will always be able to read messages,
       signatures, and keys from olderversions, even after
       September 1st.  The older versions will not be able to
       read messages, signatures and keys produced by PGP 2.6
       after September 1st.  This is an entirely different
       situation.  There is every reason for people to switch to
       PGP 2.6, because it will be able to handle both data
       formats, while the older versions will not.  Until
       September, the new PGP will continue to produce the old
       format that can be read by older versions, but will start
       producing the new format after that date.  This delay
       allows time for everyone to obtain the new version of
       PGP, so that they will not be affected by the change.
       Key servers will still be able to carry the keys made in
       the old format, because PGP 2.6 will still read them with
       no problems. "  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted
       to Usenet groups] [all dates here refer to 1994]

       this new
       arrangement is a breakthrough in the legal status of PGP,
       of benefit to
       all PGP users.  I urge all PGP users to switch to PGP
       2.6, and abandon
       earlier versions.  The widespread replacement of the old
       versions with
       this new version of PGP fits in with future plans for the
       creation of a
       PGP standard."  [Phil Zimmermann, 1994-07-07, also posted

     correspond to the source. That this _can_ be done is enough
     for me. (Strategy: Hold on to the code for a while, wait

     sometimes reveal identities, as do inadvertent comments and

                    - Modern ciphers use keys that are far beyond memorization
     (or even typing in!). The key is usually stored on one's
     home machine, or a machine that is reasonably secure, or on
     diskette. The passphrase should always be memorized or
     written down (ugh) in one's wallet or other such place.
     Secure "dongles" worn around the neck, or a ring or watch,
     may eventually be used. Smartcards and PDAs are a more
     likely intermediate solution (many PCs now have PCMCIA card
     slots).

                    - "One of the better uses for key fingerprints is for
     inclusion in signature files and other places that a key
     itself is too bulky.  By widespread dissemination of the
     fingerprint, the chances of a bogus key being undetected
     are decreased, since there are more channels for the
     fingerprint to get to recipients, and more channels for the
     owner of a key to see any bogus fingerprints out on the
     net. [Bill Stewart, 1994-08-31]

                    - One way is to issue .... "User-id revocation certificates
     are a *good* idea and the PGP key format allows for them -
     maybe one day PGP will do something about it." [Paul Allen,

                <li>
                    - Persistent e-mail addresses is one approach. Some  people
     are using organization like the ACM to provide this (e.g.,
     Phil Zimmermann is prz@acm.org). Others are using remapping
     services.  For example, "I signed up with the SLED (Stable
     Large E-mail Database), which is a cross-referencing
     database for linking old, obsolete E-mail addresses with
     current ones over the course of time.... Anyone using this
     key will always be able to find me on the SLED by
     conducting a search with "blbrooks..." as the keyword. Thus
     my key and associated sigs always remain good....  If you
     are interested in the SLED, its address is
     sled@drebes.com." [Robert Brooks, alt.security.pgp, 1994-07-

                    - Derek Atkins answered a similar question on sci.crypt:
     "Sure.  You can use PGP to verify your keyring, and using
     the web-of-trust, you can then have it verify your
     signatures all the keys that you signed, and recurse
     through your circle-of-friends.  To verify that your own
     key was not munged, you can sign something with your secret
     key and then try to verify it.  This will ensure that your
     public key wasn't munged." [Derek Atkins, sci.crypt, 1994-

                    - They're not saying. Ironically, this violates the part of
     their charter that deals with making commercial security
     stronger. Now that PGP is kosher, they should help to make
     it stronger, and certainly should not keep mum about
     weaknesses they know about. But for them to help strengthen
     PGP is not really too likely.

                    - "Suitable timing constraints, and in particular real-time
     constraints, can be used to hinder, and perhaps defeat,
     spoofing attacks.  But with a store-and-forward e-mail
     system (such as PGP is designed to work with) these
     constraints cannot, in general, be set." [Ken Pizzini ,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Yes, but many of us are. Many folks have analyzed the
     source code in PGP, have compiled the code themselves (a
     fairly common way to get the executable), and have examined
     the random number generators, the selection of primes, and
     all of the other math.

                <li>
                    + It would take only a single sharp-eyed person to blow the
     whistle on a conspiracy to insert flaws or backdoors. This
     has not been done. (Though Colin Plumb ackknowledged a
     slight weakness in the RNG of 2.6...being fixed.)

       that the program is secure, it helps a lot.  Even though
       many users are not programmers or cryptographers, others
       are, and many of these will examine the code    carefully
       and publicly yell about weaknesses that they notice or
       think they notice.  For example, apparently there was a
       big discussion here about the xorbytes() bug in PGP 2.6.
       Contrast this with a commercial program, where such a bug
       might go undetected for years." [Paul Rubin,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Sure, but the sysops and others may then have access to
     your key and passphrase. Only machines the user directly
     controls, and that are adequately firewalled from other
     machines, offer reasonable amounts of security.  Arguing
     about whether 1024-bit keylengths are "enough" is rather
     moot if the PGP program is being run on a corportate
     computer, or a university network. The illusion of security
     may be present, but no real security. Too many people are
     kidding themselves that their messages are secure.  That
     their electronic identities cannot be spoofed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - I'm not interested in the various elm and emacs PGP
     packages (several such shells and wrappers exist). Any
     sysop can not only obtain your secret key, stored on
     hissystem, but he can also capture your passphrase as you
     feed it to the PGP program (assuming you do...many people
     automate this part as well). Since this sysop or one of his
     cronies can then compromise your mail, sign messages and
     contracts as "you," I consider this totally unacceptable.
     Others apparently don't.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - What can be done? Many of us only run PGP on home machines,
     or on machines we directly control. Some folks who use PGP
     on such machines at least take steps to better secure
     things....Perry Metzger, for example, once described the
     multi-stage process he went through each day to reload his
     key material in a way he felt was quasi-safe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Until the "Internet-in-a-box" or TIA-type products are more
     widespread, many people will be connecting home or office
     machines to other systems they don't control. (To put this
     in sharper focus: do you want your electronic money being
     run out of an account that your sysop and his friends can
     monitor? Not hardly. "Electronic purses," which may be
     smart cards, Newton-like PDAs, or dongle-like rings or
     pendants, are clearly needed. Another entire discussion.)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The outcome is not final, but on balance I think the
     position of RSADSI is helped by the publicity PGP has
     generated. Users of PGP will "graduate" to fully-licensed
     versions, in many cases. Corporations will then use
     RSADSI's products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Interestingly, PGP could do the "radical" things that

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Remailers are essential for anonymous and pseudonymous

                <li>
                    - Cypherpunks remailers have been one of the major successes,
     appearing at about the time of the Kleinpaste/Julf
     remailer(s), but now expanding to many sites

                    - This remains one of the most jumbled and confusing
     sections, in my opinion. It needs a lot more reworking and
     reorganizing.

     proposals, discussion points, and other such stuff. No FAQ
     could begin to cover the ground covered in the literally
     thousands of posts on remailers.

        <h5>
                8.3.1. Why is anonymity so important?
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - It allows escape from past, an often-essential element of
     straighening out (an important function of the Western
     frontier, the French Foreign Legion, etc., and something we
     are losing as the dossiers travel with us wherever we go)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - It allows new and diverse types of opinions, as noted below
                </li>
                <li>
                    - More basically, anonymity is important because identity is
     not as important as has been made out in our dossier
     society. To wit, if Alice wishes to remain anonymous or
     pseudonymous to Bob, Bob cannot "demand" that she provide
     here "real" name. It's a matter of negotiation between
     them. (Identity is not free...it is a credential like any
     other and cannot be demanded, only negotiated.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Voting, reading habits, personal behavior...all are
     examples where privacy (= anonymity, effectively) are
     critical. The next section gives a long list of reasons for
     anonymity.

                    + Not much, at one level...we often use the term "digital
     pseudonym" in a strong sense, in which the actual identity
     cannot be deduced easily

     hearsay and even false comments. (A disturbing trend has
     been the tendency to sue, or threaten suits. And

       the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from
       time to time throughout history have been able to
       criticize oppressive practices and laws either

       Greg adds: "It later says "Even the Federalist Papers,
       written in favor of the adoption of our Constitution,
       were published under fictitious names. It is plain that
       anonymity has sometimes been assumed for the most
       constructive purposes." [Greg Broiles, 1994-04-12]

     hang out on technical newsgroups would be very familiar
     with the anonymous review procedures practiced by academic
     journals. There is some value when a reviewer can speak
     their mind about a paper without worry of revenge. Of
     course everyone assures me that the system is never really
     anonymous because there are alwys only three or four people
     qualified to review each paper. :-) ....Perhaps we should
     go out of our way to make anonymous, technical comments
     about papers and ideas in the newsgroups to fascilitate the
     development of an anonymous commenting culture in
     cypberspace." [Peter Wayner, 1993-02-09]

                8.5.1. The Basic Idea of Remailers

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Messages are encrypted, envelopes within envelopes, thus
     making tracing based on external appearance impossible. If
     the remailer nodes keep the mapping between inputs and
     outputs secret, the "trail" is lost.

        <h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + Bear in mind that "untraceable mail" is the default
     situation for ordinary mail, where one seals an envelope,
     applies a stamp, and drops it anonymously in a letterbox.
     No records are kept, no return address is required (or
     confirmed), etc.
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            + Many of us believe that the current system of anonymous

                                    - Postal Service would demand personalized stamps,
         verifiable return addresses, etc. (not foolproof, or

       computers from Usenet (because of British laws about
       libel, about pornography, and such): "PGP hides the

       paranoid remailers introduce a random delay on resending
       to foil traffic analysis. You'd be suprised what can be
       done :-).....If you use a chain then the first remailer
       knows who you are but the destination is encrypted. The
       last remailer knows the destination but cannot know the
       source. Intermediate ones know neither."  [Malcolm

                    + Hal Finney summarized the reasons nicely in an answer back
     in early 1993.

                            - "There are several different advantages provided by
       anonymous remailers. One of the simplest and least
       controversial would be to defeat traffic analysis on
       ordinary email.....Two people who wish to communicate
       privately can use PGP or some other encryption system to
       hide the content of their messages.  But the fact that
       they are communicating with each other is still visible
       to many people: sysops at their sites and possibly at
       intervening sites, as well as various net snoopers.  It
       would be natural for them to desire an additional amount
       of privacy which would disguise who they were
       communicating with as well as what they were saying.
       
       "Anonymous remailers make this possible.  By forwarding
       mail between themselves through remailers, while still
       identifying themselves in the (encrypted) message
       contents, they have even more communications privacy than
       with simple encryption.
       
       "(The Cypherpunk vision includes a world in which
       literally hundreds or thousands of such remailers
       operate.  Mail could be bounced through dozens of these
       services, mixing in with tens of thousands of other
       messages, re-encrypted at each step of the way.  This
       should make traffic analysis virtually impossible.  By
       sending periodic dummy messages which just get swallowed
       up at some step, people can even disguise _when_ they are
       communicating.)" [Hal Finney, 1993-02-23]
       
       "The more controversial vision associated with anonymous
       remailers is expressed in such science fiction stories as
       "True Names", by Vernor
       Vinge, or "Ender's Game", by Orson Scott Card.  These
       depict worlds in which computer networks are in
       widespread use, but in which many people choose to
       participate through pseudonyms.  In this way they can
       make unpopular arguments or participate in frowned-upon
       transactions without their activities being linked to
       their true identities.  It also allows people to develop
       reputations based on the quality of their ideas, rather
       than their job, wealth, age, or status." [Hal Finney,

       entire body of
       the message, without any kind of alteration, is that it
       permits you to
       send ANY body through that mailer and rely on its

                            - Signature blocks at the end of message bodies
       specifically should _not_ be stripped, even though this
       can cause security breaches if they are accidentally left
       in when not intended. Attempting to strip sigs, which
       come in many flavors, would be a nightmare and could
       strip other stuff, too. Besides, some people may want a
       sig attached, even to an encrypted message.

                            - As usual, anyone is of course free to have a remailer
       which munges message bodies as it sees fit, but  I expect
       such remailers will lose customers.

                        <li>
                            - Another possibility is another special form, such as
       "::End", that could be used to delimit the block to be
       remailed. But it'll be hard getting such a "frill"
       accepted.

       even can accept instructions to create a new subject line
       (perhaps in the last remailer).

                        <li>
                            - There are reasons not to have a subject line propagated
       through a chain of remailers: it tags the message and
       hence makes traffic analysis trivial. But there are also
       reasons to have a subject line--makes it easier on the
       recipient--and so these schemes to add a subject line
       exist.

                        <li>
                            - This could perhaps be added to the remailers, as an extra
       field. (I've heard the mail fields are more tolerant of
       added stuff than the Netnews fields are, making mail-to-
       News gateways lose the extra fields.)

         along in the clear. If you don't want this, you can
         remove it using the cutmarks feature with my remailer.
         (Also, remail@extropia.wimsey.com doesn't append the
         text after the encrypted message.)  The reason for this
         is that it allows anonymous replies.  I can create a
         pgp message for a remailer which will be delivered to
         myself.  I send you the PGP message, you append some
         text to it, and send it to the remailer.  The remailer
         decrypts it and remails it to me, and I get your
         message. [M.G., alt.privacy.anon-server, 1994-07-03]

       abuse, may choose to distribute his load to other
       remailers. Generally, he can instead of remailing to the
       next site, add sites of his own choosing. Thus, he can
       both reduce the spotlight on him and also increase cover
       traffic by scattering some percentage of his traffic to

       the focus on him).

         obscuring the relationship between any message entering

         achieve is what most of the features here are all

         so. Some remailers can pad to quantized levels, e.g.,
         to 5K or 10K or more. The levels have not been settled

         with the remailers in the return path to do certain

                            - Curiously, as much theoretical diffusivity can occur with
       a single remailer (taking in a hundred messages and
       sending out a hundred, for example) as with many
       remailers. Our intuition is, I think, that many remailers
       offer better diffusivity and better hiding. Why this is
       so (if it is) needs more careful thinking than I've seen
       done so far.

                        <li>
                            - At a meta-level, we think multiple remailers lessens the
       chance of them being compromised (this, however, is not
       directly related to the diffusivity of a remailer network-
       -important, but not directly related).

                            - (By the way, a kind of sneaky idea is to try to always
       declare one's self to be a remailer. If messages were
       somehow traced back to one's own machine, one could
       claim: 'Yes, I'm a remailer." In principle, one could be
       the only remailer in the universe and still have high
       enough diffusion and confusion. In practice, being the
       only remailer would be pretty dangerous.)

                                    - The practical effect of N remailers is to ensure that

       (which itself causes concern), some just discard
       defective mail. This is a fluid area. At least one
       remailer (wimsey) can post error messages to a message
       pool--this idea can be generalized to provide "delivery
       receipts" and other feedback.

       or she wrote (PGP Tools, Magic Money, ?).  This is quite

       that's too rarely understood by computer novices.
       Because they
       offer instant access to others, and considerable
       anonymity to
       participants, the services make it possible for people -
       especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in

       come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among
       many online
       users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of

                    - The intended target of a remailed message, and the subject
     material, may well influence the set of remailers used,
     especially for the very important "last remailer' (Note: it
     should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are
     first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact
     be able to tell he's the last...if the message is in
     plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer
     commands embedded, for example.)

     not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric

     "exciting" work, but it's still needed. There has not been
     much focus in the academic community on digital mixes or
     remailers, probably because David Chaum's 1981 paper on

       themselves right before the forged message in question.
       This shows up clearly in the sending system's sendmail
       logs. It's a point to consider with remailer chains too,

(I'm more skeptical: if each remailer is using an information-theoretically secure RNG to reorder the messages, and if all messages are the same size and (of course) are encypted with information-theoretically secure (OTP) ciphers, then it seems to me that the remailing would itself be information-theoretically secure.)

       Netcom, Portal, and Panix, cannot be counted on to stand
       and fight should pressures mount (this is just my guess,
       not an aspersion against their backbones, whether organic

     under FDA review for 5 years, but counseling advocates have
     delayed release on the grounds that some people will react
     badly and perhaps kill themselves upon getting a positive
     test result...they want the existing system to prevail. (I
     mention this to show that anonymous systems are somtimes
     opposed for ideological reasons.)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Clipper has been a main unifying force, as 80% of all
     Americans, and 95% of all computer types, are opposed.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - There have been hundreds of articles on Clipper, in nearly
     all popular magazines. Many of these were sent to the
     Cypherpunks  list and may be available in the archives. (I
     have at least 80 MB of Cypherpunks list stuff, a lot of it
     newspaper and magazine articles on Clipper!)

        <h5>
                9.3.1. What is Clipper?
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - government holds the skeleton keys
                </li>

                    - analogies to other systems
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                9.3.2. Why do most Cypherpunks oppose Clipper?
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - fear of restrictions on crypto, derailing so many wonderful
     possibilities
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                9.3.3. Why does Clipper rate its own section?
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The announcement of the "Escrowed Encryption Standard,"
     EES, on April 16, 1993, was a galvanizing event for
     Cypherpunks and for a large segment of the U. S.
     population. The EES was announced originally as "Clipper,"
     despite the use of the name Clipper by two major products
     (the Intergraph CPU and a dBase software tool), and the
     government backed off on the name. Too late, though, as the
     name "Clipper" had become indelibly linked to this whole
     proposal.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                9.3.4. "Is stopping Clipper the main goal of Cypherpunks?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - It certainly seems so at times, as Clipper has dominated
     the topics since the Clipper announcement in April, 1993.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + it has become so, with monkeywrenching efforts in several
     areas
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - lobbying and education against it (though informal, such
       lobbying has been successful...look at NYT article)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - "Big Brother Inside" and t-shirts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - technical monkeywrenching (Matt Blaze...hesitate to claim
       any credit, but he has been on our list, attended a
       meeting, etc.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Developing new software tools, writing code, deploying
     remailers and digital cash are long-range projects of great
     importance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The Clipper key escrow proposal came along (4-93) at an
     opportune time for Cypherpunks and became a major focus.
     Emergency meetings, analyses, etc.

        9.4. Crypto Policy Issues
    </h4>


        <h5>
                9.4.1. Peter Denning on crypto policy:
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + provided by Pat Farrell, 1994-08-20; Denning comments are
     1992-01-22, presented at Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2.
     Peter D. uses the metaphor of a "clearing,"as in a forest,
     for the place where people meet to trade, interact, etc.
     What others call markets, agoras, or just "cyberspace."
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "Information technology in producing a clearing in which
       individuals and corporations are key players besides
       government. Any attempt by government to control the flow
       of information over networks will be ignored or met with
       outright hostility.  There is no practical way that
       government can control information except information
       directly involved in the business of governing.  It
       should not try." [Peter Denning, PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE
       21ST CENTURY, DRAFT 1/22/92]

     the NSA (which probably has rigged it so any changes are
     detectable and can be factored in)

        9.5. Motivations for Crypto Laws
    </h4>


        <h5>
                9.5.1. "What are the law enforcement and FBI worries?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "FBI Director Louis Freeh is worried. The bad guys are
     beginning to see the light, and it is digital. ... Freeh
     fears some pretty nasty folks have discovered they can
     commit highway robbery and more, without even leaving home.
     Worse, to Freeh and other top cops, by using some pretty
     basic technologies, savvy criminals can do their crimes
     without worrying about doing time.
     
     "Some crooks, spies, drug traffickers, terrorists and
     frauds already use the tools of the information age to
     outfox law enforcement officers. Hackers use PBXs to hide
     their tracks as they rip off phone companies and poke
     around in other people's files. Reprogrammed cellular
     phones give cops fits." [LAN Magazine,"Is it 1984?," by Ted
     Bunker, August 1994]
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Their fears have some validity...in the same way that the
     rulers in Gutenberg's time could have some concerns about
     the implications of books (breaking of guilds, spread of
     national secrets, pornography, atheism, etc.).
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                9.5.2. "What motivated Clipper? What did the Feds hope to gain?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - ostensibly to stop terrorists (only the unsophisticated
     ones, if alternatives are allowed)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - to force a standard on average Americans
                </li>
                <li>
                    - possibly to limit crypto development
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Phil Karn provides an interesting motivation for Clipper:
     "Key escrow exists only because the NSA doesn't want to
     risk blame if some terrorist or drug dealer were to use an
     unescrowed NSA-produced .....The fact that a terrorist or
     drug dealer can easily go elsewhere and obtain other strong
     or stronger algorithms without key escrow is irrelevant.
     The NSA simply doesn't care as long as *they* can't be
     blamed for whatever happens. Classic CYA, nothing
     more.....A similar analysis applies to the export control
     regulations regarding cryptography." [Phil Karn, 1994-08-
     31]
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                9.5.3. Steve Witham has an interesting take on why folks like Dorothy Denning and Donn Parker support key escrow so ardently:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "Maybe people like Dot and Don think of government as a
     systems-administration sort of job.  So here they are,
     security experts advising the sys admins on things like...
     
     setting permissions
     allocating quotas
     registering users and giving them passwords.....
     deciding what utilities are and aren't available
     deciding what software the users need, and installing it
              (grudgingly, based on who's yelling the loudest)
     setting up connections to other machines
     deciding who's allowed to log in from "foreign hosts"
     getting mail set up and running
     buying new hardware from vendors
     specifying the hardware to the vendors
     ...
     
     "These are the things computer security experts advise on.
     Maybe hammer experts see things as nails.

     by the government, and citizens are not guests or users."

     NSA actually has a charter to help businesses protect their
     secrets; just not so strongly that the crypto is
     unbreakable by them. (This of course has been part of the

     transmissions in the clear, or that keys be provided to the
     government. The Phillipines, for example. And certainly
     regimes in the Communists Bloc, or what's left of it, will
     likely have various laws restricting crypto. Possibly
     draconian laws....in many cultures, use of crypto is
     tantamount to espionage.

     already have more Draconian policies on the private use of
     encryption than the U.S. is even contemplating
     (publically). France outlaws private crypto, though
     enforcement is said to be problematic (but I would not want

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Various European countries have passed laws about the
     compiling of computerized records on people without their
     explicit permission. This applies to nearly all
     computerized records--mailing lists, dossiers, credit
     records, employee files, etc.--though some exceptions exist
     and, in general, companies can find ways to compile records
     and remain within the law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The rules are open to debate, and the casual individual who
     cannot afford lawyers and advisors, is likely to be
     breaking the laws repeatedly. For example, storing the
     posts of people on the Cypherpunks list in any system
     retrievable by name would violate Britain's Data Privacy
     laws. That almost no such case would ever result in a
     prosecution (for practical reasons) does not mean the laws
     are acceptable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - To many, these laws are a "good idea." But the laws miss
     the main point, give a false sense of security (as the real
     dossier-compilers are easily able to obtain exemptions, or
     are government agencies themselves), and interfere in what
     people do with information that properly and legally comes
     there way. (Be on the alert for "civil rights" groups like
     the ACLU and EFF to push for such data privacy laws. The
     irony of Kapor's connection to Lotus and the failed
     "Marketplace" CD-ROM product cannot be ignored.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Creating a law which bans the keeping of certain kinds of
     records is an invitation to having "data inspectors"
     rummaging through one's files. Or some kind of spot checks,
     or even software key escrow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - (Strong crypto makes these laws tough to enforce. Either
     the laws go, or the counties with such laws will then have
     to limit strong crypto....not that that will help in the
     long run.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The same points apply to well-meaning proposals to make
     employer monitoring of employees illegal. It sounds like a
     privacy-enhancing idea, but it tramples upon the rights of
     the employer to ensure that work is being done, to
     basically run his business as he sees fit, etc. If I hire a
     programmer and he's using my resources, my network
     connections, to run an illegal operation, he exposes my
     company to damages, and of course he isn't doing the job I
     paid him to do. If the law forbids me to monitor this
     situation, or at least to randomly check, then he can
     exploit this law to his advantage and to my disadvantage.

     solutions,(lied game theory.)

                    - The Digital Telephony Bill, first proposed under Bush and
     again by Clinton, is in many ways much worse than Clipper.
     It has gotten less attention, for various reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - For one thing,  it is seen as an extension by some of
     existing wiretap capabilities. And, it is fairly abstract,
     happening behind the doors of telephone company switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The implications are severe: mandatory wiretap and pen
     register (who is calling whom) capaibilities, civil
     penalties of up to $10,000 a day for insufficient
     compliance, mandatory assistance must be provided, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - If it is passed, it could dictate future technology. Telcos
     who install it will make sure that upstart technologies
     (e.g., Cypherpunks who find ways to ship voice over
     computer lines) are also forced to "play by the same
     rules." Being required to install government-accessible tap
     points even in small systems would of course effectively
     destroy them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - On the other hand, it is getting harder and harder to make

     a bogus LEAF, the Clipper chip on the other end would
     accept and decrypt the communication, but the back door
     would not work for the government." [ Steve Brinich,

     And mad metaphors. Misplaced zeal, confusing tangential
     developments with real progress. Much like libertarians

       Two answers:
       
       1) the people you want to communicate with won't have
       hardware to
          decrypt your data, statistically speaking.  The beauty
       of clipper
          from the NSA point of view is that they are leveraging
       the
          installed base (they hope) of telephones and making it
       impossible
          (again, statistically) for a large fraction of the
       traffic to be
          untappable.
       
       2) They won't license bad people like you to make
       equipment like the
          system you describe.  I'll wager that the chip
       distribution will be
          done in a way to prevent significant numbers of such
       systems from
          being built, assuring that (1) remains true." [Tom

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + John Gilmore answered this question in a nice essay. I'm
     including the whole thing, including a digression into
     cellular telephones, because it gives some insight--and
     names some names of NSA liars--into how NSA and NIST have
     used their powers to thwart true security.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "It's worse because the market keeps moving toward
       providing real encryption.
       
       "If Clipper succeeds, it will be by displacing real
       secure encryption. If real secure encryption makes it
       into mass market communications products, Clipper will
       have failed.  The whole point is not to get a few
       Clippers used by cops; the point is to make it a
       worldwide standard, rather than having 3-key triple-DES
       with RSA and Diffie-Hellman become the worldwide
       standard.
       
       "We'd have decent encryption in digital cellular phones
       *now*, except for the active intervention of Jerry
       Rainville of NSA, who `hosted' a meeting of the standards
       committee inside Ft. Meade, lied to them about export
       control to keep committee documents limited to a small
       group, and got a willing dupe from Motorola, Louis
       Finkelstein, to propose an encryption scheme a child
       could break.  The IS-54 standard for digital cellular
       doesn't describe the encryption scheme -- it's described
       in a separate document, which ordinary people can't get,
       even though it's part of the official accredited
       standard.  (Guess who accredits standards bodies though -
       - that's right, the once pure NIST.)
       
       "The reason it's secret is because it's so obviously
       weak.  The system generates a 160-bit "key" and then
       simply XORs it against each block of the compressed
       speech.  Take any ten or twenty blocks and recover the
       key by XORing frequent speech patterns (like silence, or
       the letter "A") against pieces of the blocks to produce
       guesses at the key.  You try each guess on a few blocks,
       and the likelihood of producing something that decodes
       like speech in all the blocks is small enough that you'll
       know when your guess is the real key.
       
       "NSA is continuing to muck around in the Digital Cellular
       standards committee (TR 45.3) this year too.  I encourage
       anyone who's interested to join the committee, perhaps as
       an observer.  Contact the Telecommunications Industry
       Association in DC and sign up.  Like any standards
       committee, it's open to the public and meets in various
       places around the country.  I'll lend you a lawyer if
       you're a foreign national, since the committee may still
       believe that they must exclude foreign nationals from
       public discussions of cryptography.  Somehow the crypto
       conferences have no trouble with this; I think it's
       called the First Amendment.  NSA knows the law here --
       indeed it enforces it via the State Dept -- but lied to
       the committee." [John Gilmore, "Why is clipper worse than

                9.18.8. In my view, any focus on the details of Clipper instead of the overall concept of key escrow plays into their hands. This is not to say that the work of Blaze and others is misguided....in fact, it's very fine work. But a general focus on the _details_ of Skipjack does nothing to allay my concerns about the _principle_ of government-mandated crypto. If it were "house key escrow" and there were missing details about the number of teeth allowed on the keys, would be then all breathe a sigh of relief if the details of the teeth were clarified? Of course not. Me, I will never use a key escrow system, even if a blue ribbon panel of hackers and Cypherpunks studies the design and declares it to be cryptographically sound.

        10.3. Basic Legality of Encryption
    </h4>


        <h5>
                10.3.1. "Is this stuff legal or illegal?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Certainly the _talking_ about it is mostly legal, at least
     in the U.S. and at the time of this writing. In other
     countries, you prison term may vary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + The actions resulting from crypto, and crypto anarchy, may
     well be illegal. Such is often the case when technology is
     applied without any particular regard for what the laws say
     is permitted. (Pandora's Box and all that.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - Cypherpunks really don't care much about such ephemera as
       the "laws" of some geographic region. Cypherpunks make
       their own laws.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - First, looking at the law and regulations and finding
       ways to exploit them. This is the tack favored by
       lawyers, of whic$are many in this country.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Second, "just do it." In areas where the law hasn't
       caught up, this can mean unconstrained technological
       developement. Good examples are the computer and chip
       business, where issues of legality rarely arose (except
       in the usual areas of contract enforcement, etc.). More
       recently the chip business has discovered lawyering, with
       a vengeance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - In other areas, where the law is centrally involved,
       "just do it" can mean many technical violations of the
       law. Examples: personal service jobs (maids and
       babysitters), contracting jobs without licenses,
       permissions, etc., and so on. Often these are "illegal
       markets," putatively.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                10.3.2. "Why is the legal status of crypto so murky?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - First, it may be murkier to me than it it to actual lawyers
     like Mike Godwin and Michael Froomkin, both of whom have
     been on our list at times. (Though my impression from
     talking to Godwin is that many or even most of these issues
     have not been addressed in the courts, let alone resolved
     definitively.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Second, crypto issues have not generally reached the
     courts, reflecting the nascent status of most of the things
     talked about it here. Things as "trivial" as digital
     signatures and digital timestamping have yet to be
     challenged in courts, or declared illegal, or anything
     similar that might produce a precedent-setting ruling. (Stu
     Haber agrees that such tests are lacking.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Finally, the issues are deep ones, going to the heart of
     issues of self-incrimination (disclosure of keys,
     contempt), of intellectual property and export laws (want
     to jail someone for talking about prime numbers?), and the
     incredibly byzantine world of money and financial
     instruments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - A legal study of crypto--which I hear Professor Froomkin is
     doing--could be very important.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                10.3.3. "Has the basic legality of crypto and laws about crypto been tested?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - As usual, a U.S. focus here. I know little of the situation
     in non-U.S. countries (and in many of them the law is
     whatever the rulers say it is).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And I'm not a lawyer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Some facts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - no direct Constitutional statement about privacy (though
       many feel it is implied)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - crypto was not a major issue (espionage was, and was
       dealt with harshly, but encrypting things was not a
       problem per se)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            + only in the recent past has it become important...and it
       will become much more so
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    - as criminals encrypt, as terrorists encrypt
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - as tax is avoided via the techniques described here
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - collusion of business ("crypto interlocking
         directorates," price signalling)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - black markets, information markets
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            - scary, as it may place limits.... (but unlikely to
       happen)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    + Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the EFF, has been asked this
     queston _many_ times:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "Note that a court could cite you for contempt for not
       complying with a subpoena duces tecum (a subpoena
       requiring you to produce objects or documents) if you
       fail to turn over subpoenaed backups....To be honest, I
       don't think *any* security measure is adequate against a
       government that's determined to overreach its authority
       and its citizens' rights, but crypto comes close." [Mike
       Godwin, 1993-06-14]
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            - "Remember the instructions for cooking a live frog.  The
       government does not intend to stop until they have
       effectively eliminated your privacy.
       
       STEP 1:  Clipper becomes the de facto encryption
       standard.
       
       STEP 2:  When Cypherpunks and other "criminals" eschew
       Clipper in favor of trusted strong crypto, the government
       is "forced" to ban non-escrowed encryption systems.
       (Gotta catch those pedophiles, drug dealers and
       terrorists, after all.)
       
       STEP 3:  When Cypherpunks and other criminals use
       superencryption with Clipper or spoof LEAFs, the
       government will regretably be forced to engage in random
       message monitoring to detect these illegal techniques.
       
       Each of these steps will be taken because we wouldn't
       passively accept such things as unrestricted wiretaps and
       reasonable precautions like
       digital telephony.  It will portrayed as our fault.

       that's too rarely understood by computer novices.
       Because they
       offer instant access to others, and considerable
       anonymity to
       participants, the services make it possible for people -
       especially computer-literate kids - to find themselves in
       unpleasant, sexually explicit social situations....  And

       come to adopt the view, which will be controversial among
       many online
       users, that the use of nicknames and other forms of
       anonymity
       must be eliminated or severly curbed to force people

                    - The intended target of a remailed message, and the subject
     material, may well influence the set of remailers used,
     especially for the very important "last remailer' (Note: it
     should never be necessary to tell remailers if they are
     first, last, or others, but the last remailer may in fact
     be able to tell he's the last...if the message is in
     plaintext to the recipient, with no additional remailer
     commands embedded, for example.)

                <li>
                    - A message involving child pornography might have a remailer
     site located in a state like Denmark, where child porn laws
     are less restrictive. And a message critical of Islam might
     not be best sent through a final remailer in Teheran. Eric
     Hughes has dubbed this "regulatory arbitrage," and to
     various extents it is already common practice.

                    - Of course, the sender picks the remailer chain, so these
     common sense notions may not be followed. Nothing is
     perfect, and customs will evolve. I can imagine schemes
     developing for choosing customers--a remailer might not
     accept as a customer certain abusers, based on digital
     pseudonyms &lt; hairy).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - First, there are so few current remailers that this is
     unlikely. Julf seems a non-narc type, and he is located in
     Finland. The Cypherpunks remailers are mostly run by folks
     like us, for now.

                <li>
                    - However, such stings and set-ups have been used in the past
     by narcs and "red squads." Expect the worse from Mr.
     Policeman. Now that evil hackers are identified as hazards,
     expect moves in this direction. "Cryps" are obviously
     "crack" dealers.

                    - Perry Metzger notes, bearer bonds are now illegal in the
     U.S. (a bearer bond represented cash, in that no name was
     attached to the bond--the "bearer" could sell it for cash
     or redeem it...worked great for transporting large amounts
     of cash in compact form).

       1982 (TEFRA), any interest payments made on *new* issues
       of domestic bearer bonds are not deductible as an
       ordinary and necessary business expense so none have been
       issued since then.  At the same time, the Feds
       administratively stopped issuing treasury securities in
       bearer form.  Old issues of government and corporate debt
       in bearer form still exist and will exist and trade for
       30 or more years after 1982.  Additionally, US residents
       can legally buy foreign bearer securities." [Duncan

       Bearer Bond issues mature in 1997. I also believe that to
       collect interest, and to redeem the bond at maturity, you
       must give your name and tax-id number to the paying
       agent. (I can check with the department here that handles
       it if anyone is interested in the pertinent OCC regs that
       apply)"  [prig0011@gold.tc.umn.edu, 1994-08-10]

        <h5>
                10.9.1. In terms of banking laws, cash reporting regulations, money laundering statutes, and the welter of laws connected with financial transactions of all sorts, the Cypherpunks themes and ideas are basically _illegal_. Illegal in the sense that anyone trying to set up his own bank, or alternative currency system, or the like would be shut down quickly. As an informal, unnoticed _experiment_, such things are reasonably safe...until they get noticed.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                10.9.2. The operative word here is "launch," in my opinion. The "launch" of the BankAmericard (now VISA) in the 1960s was not done lightly or casually...it required armies of lawyers, accountants, and other bureacrats to make the launch both legal and successful. The mere 'idea" of a credit card was not enough...that was essentially the easiest part of it all. (Anyone contemplating the launch of a digital cash system would do well to study BankAmericard as an example...and several other examples also.)

        <h5>
                10.9.3. The same will be true of any digital cash or similar system which intends to operate more or less openly, to interface with existing financial institutions, and which is not explicity intended to be a Cypherpunkish underground activity.

There's been a lot of media attention given to this, especially pedophilia (pedophilia is not the same thing as porn, of course, but the two are often discussed in articles about the Net). As Rishab Ghosh put it: "I think the pedophilic possibilities of the Internet capture the imaginations of the media -- their deepest desires, perhaps." [R.G., 1994-07-01]

        <h5>
                10.12.2. The fact is, the two are made for each other.

                10.12.6. There are new prospects for delivery of messages as part of stings or entrapment attacks, where the bits decrypt into incriminating evidence when the right key is used. (XOR of course)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                10.12.7. Just as the law enforcement folks are claiming, strong crypto and remailers will make new kinds of porn networks. The nexus or source will not be known, and the customers will not be known.

On the subject of Usenet possibly being shut-down in the U.K. (a recent rumor, unsubstantiated), this comment: " What you have to grasp is that USENET type networks and the whole structure of the law on publshing are fundamentally incompatiable. With USENT anyone can untracably distribute pornographic, libelous, blasphemous, copyright or even officially secret information. Now, which do you think HMG and, for that matter, the overwhealming majority of oridnary people in this country think is most important. USENET or those laws?"

Sedition laws, conspiracy laws, RICO, etc. How long before speaking on these matters earns a warning letter from your university or your company? (It's the "big stick" of ultimate government action that spurs these university and company policies. Apple fears being shut down for having "involvement" with a terrorist plot, Emory University fears being sued for millions of dollars for "conspiring" to degrade wimmin of color, etc.) How long before "rec.guns" is no longer carried at many sites, as they fear having their universities or companies linked to discussions of "assault weapons" and "cop-killer bullets"? Prediction: Many companies and universities, under pressure from the Feds, will block groups in which encrypted files are posted. After all, if one encrypts, one must have something to hide, and that could expose the university to legal action from some group that feels aggrieved.

                10.17.3. Free speech is under assault across the country. The tort system is being abused to stifle dissenting views (and lest you think I am only a capitalist, only a free marketeer, the use of "SLAPP suits"--"Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation"--by corporations or real estate developers to threaten those who dare to publicly speak against their projects is a travesty, a travesty that the courts have only recently begun to correct). We are becoming a nation of sheep, fearing the midnight raid, the knock on the door. We fear that if we tell a joke, someone will glare at us and threaten to sue us _and_ our company! And so companies are adopting "speech codes" and other such baggage of the Orwell's totalitarian state. Political correctness is extending its tendrils into nearly every aspect of life in America.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - (This topic has significance for crypto and remailers, vis
     a vis whether remailers are to be treated as common
     carriers.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Common carriers are what the phone and package delivery
     services are. They are not held liable for the contents of
     phone calls, for the contents of packages (drugs,
     pornography, etc.), or for illegal acts connected with
     their services. One of the deals is that common carriers
     not examine the insides of packages.  Common carriers
     essentially agree to take all traffic that pays the fee and
     not to discriminate based on content. Thus, a phone service
     will not ask what the subject of a call is to be, or listen
     in, to decide whether to make the connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Some say that to be a common carrier requires a willingness
     to work with law enforcement. That is, Federal Express is
     not responsible for contents of packages, but they have to
     cooperate in reasonable ways with law enforcement to open
     or track suspicious packages. Anybody have a cite for this?
     Is it true?
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Common carrier status is also cited for bookstores, which
     are not presumed to have read each and every one of the
     books they sell...so if somebody blows their hand off in a
     an experiment, the bookstore is not liable.  (The
     author/publisher may be, but that's aänt issue.)

                <li>

       most to do with being unable to reject passengers, goods,
       or phone calls......Plenty of non-common carrier entities
       are immune from prosecution for ideas that they
       unkowingly communicate -- bookstores for example (unless
       they are *knowingly* porno bookstores in the wrong
       jurisdiction)....Compuserve was held not liable for an
       (alleged) libel by one of its sysops.  Not because of
       common carrier but because they had no knowledge or
       control....Remailers have no knowledge or control hence
       no scienter (guilty knowledge) hence no liability as a
       matter of law---not a jury question BTW." [Duncan

        </h5>

        <h5>
                10.19.2. I take a radical view. Ask yourself why credentials are _ever_ needed. Maybe for driving a car, and the like, but in those cases anonymity is not needed, as the person is in the car, etc. Credentials for drinking age? Why? Let the parents enforce this, as the argument goes about watching sex and violence on t.v. (If one accepts the logic of requiring bars to enforce children's behavior, then one is on a slippery slope toward requiring television set makers to check smartcards of viewers, or of requiring a license to access the Internet, etc.) In almost no cases do I see the need to carry "papers" with me. Maybe a driver's license, like I said. In other areas, why?

        <h5>
                10.19.3. So Cypherpunks probably should not spend too much time worrying about how permission slips and "hall passes" will be handled. Little need for them.

                <li>
                    - In transactions where "future performance" is needed, as in
     a contract to have a house built, or to do some similar
     job, then of course the idea of on-line or immediate
     clearing is bogus...like paying a stranger a sum of money
     on his promise that he'll be back the next day to start
     building you a house.
     
     Parties to such long-term, non-locally-cleared cases may
     contract with an escrow agent, as I described above. This
     is like the "privately-produced law" we've discussed so
     many times. The essence: voluntary arrangements.
     
     Maybe proofs of identity will be needed, or asked for,
     maybe not. But these are not the essence of the deal.

                <li>
                    - On-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all
     trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify
     that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob
     would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been
     credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of
     the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over
     computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem
     and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as
     time, and has always involved protcols in which trust,
     repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Long before the "key escrow" of Clipper, true escrow was
     planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Alice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts
     the other;
     indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps "Esther's
     Escrow Service." She is _also utraceable_, but has
     established a digitally-signed presence and a good
     reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow
     agent, like a bonding agency, not in "burning" either
     party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the
     profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is
     less than her "reputation capital," it is in her interest
     to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is
     also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from
     burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by
     suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Alice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with
     Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release
     the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both
     parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc.
     (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes
     are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that
     Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)

                <li>
                    - "Bank regulations in this country are kept deliberately
     somewhat vague.  The regulator's word is the deciding
     principle, not a detailed interpretation of statute.  The
     lines are fuzzy, and because they are fuzzy, the banks
     don't press on them nearly as hard as when there's clear
     statutory language available to be interpreted in a court.
     
     "The uncertainty in the regulatory environment _increases_
     the hold the regulators have over the banks.  And the
     regulators are known for being decidedly finicky.  Their
     decisions are largely not subject to appeal (except for the
     flagrant stuff, which the regulators are smart enough not
     to do too often), and there's no protection against cross-
     linking issues.  If a bank does something untoward in, say,
     mortgage banking, they may find, say, their interstate
     branching possibilities seem suddenly much dimmer.

                    - Attempts to sneak around the laws, especially in the
     context of alternative currencies, Perry Metzger notes:
     "They are simply trying to stop you from playing games. The
     law isn't like geometry -- there aren't axioms and rules
     for deriving one thing from another. The general principle
     is that they want to track all your transactions, and if
     you make it difficult they will either use existing law to
     jail you, or will produce a new law to try to do the same."

                <li>
                    - This fuzziness and regulatory discretion is closely related
     to those wacky schemes to avoid taxes by claiming , for
     example, that the "dollar" is defined as 1/35th of an ounce
     of gold (and that hence one's earnings in "real dollars"
     are a tiny fraction of the ostensible earnings), that Ohio
     did not legally enter the Union and thus the income tax was
     never properly ratified,, etc. Lots of these theories have
     been tested--and rejected. I mention this because some
     Cypherpunks show signs of thinking "digital cash" offers
     similar opportunities. (And I expect to see similar scams.)

                <li>
                    - (A related example. Can one's accumulation of money be
     taken out of the country? Depending on who you ask, "it
     depends." Taking it out in your suitcase rasises all kind
     of possibilies of seizure (violation of currency export
     laws, money laundering, etc.). Wiring it out may invoke
     FinCEN triggers. The IRS may claim it is "capital flight"
     to avoid taxes--which it may well be. Basically, your own
     money is no longer yours. There may be ways to do this--I
     hope so--but the point remains that the rules are fuzzy,
     and the discretionary powers to seize assets are great.
     Seek competent counsel, and then pray.)

       agents public key."  After that, only the escrow agent
       could decrypt your disk.  Of course, the escrow agent

                11.3.1. We've come a long way from Secretary of State Stimpson's famous "Gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail" statement. It is now widely taken for granted that Americans are to be monitored, surveilled, and even wiretapped by the various intelligence agencies. The FBI, the National Security Agency, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office, etc. (Yes, these groups have various charters telling them who they can spy on, what legalities they have to meet, etc. But they still spy. And there's not an uproar--the "What have you got to hide?" side of the American privacy dichotomy.)

     them in secret, and listen to _everything_.  To listen to
     everything with bludgeons and pharmaceuticals would not
     only cost more in labor and equipment, but also engender a
     radicalizing backlash to an actual police state." [Eric
     Hughes, 1994-01-26]

     easy for governments to routinely monitor their citizens,
     using automated technology that requires drastically less
     human involvement than previous police states required.

       telegraphs, ITT, collusion with FBI, etc.)
    * reciprocal arrangements with GCHQ (U.K.)
    * arrangements on Indian reservations for microwave
       intercepts
    * the general technology allows it (SIGINT, phone lines)
    * the National Security Act of 1947, and later
       clarifications and Executive Orders, makes it likely

     overseas communications, how they sold deliberately-
     crippled crypto machines to Third World nations, and how
     much they fear the spread of strong, essentially
     unbreakable crypto. "The Puzzle Palace" was published in

     how U.S. national security interests are being threatened
     by "unbreakable crypto." (I like some Clancy novels, but
     there's no denying he is a right-winger who's openly
     critical of social trends, and that he believes druggies
     should be killed, the government is necessary to ward off

                    - An interesting sign of things to come is provided in this
     tale from a list member:  "In Britain we have 'TV detector
     Vans'. These are to detect licence evaders (you need to pay
     an annual licence for the BBC channels). They are provided
     by the Department of Trade and Industry. They use something
     like a small minibus and use Van Eck principles. They have
     two steerable detectors on the van roof so they can
     triangulate. But TV shops have to notify the Government of
     buyers - so that is the basic way in which licence evaders
     are detected. ... I read of a case on a bulletin board
     where someone did not have a TV but used a PC. He got a
     knock on the door. They said he appeared to have a TV but
     they could not make out what channel he was watching!

     illegal copies of Microsoft Word or SimCity!   (This area

                            - Some of us speculate that this is so, that this has been
       going on since the 1960s at least. For example, Bamford
       noted in 1982 that the NSA had foreknowledge of the plans
       by the British to devalue the pound in the late 1970s,
       and knowledge of various corporate plans.

       impossible for the NSA not to have known about CIA drug
       smuggling activities. The NSA is very circumspect,
       however, and rarely (or never) comments.

                <li>
                    - First, laws which tell people what records they are
     "allowed" to keep are wrong-headed, and lead to police
     state inspections of disk drives, etc. The so-called "Data
     Privacy" laws of several European nations are a nightmare.
     Strong crypto makes them moot.

                <li>
                    - Second, it is mostly up to people to protect what they want

                </li>
                <li>
                    - In practice, this means either use cash or make
     arrangements with banks and credit card companies that will
     protect privacy. Determining if they have or not is another
     issue, but various ideas suggest themselves (John Gilmore
     says he often joins groups under variants of his name, to

     market demand. Digital cash is an example. Other variants
     abound. Cypherpunks should not allow such alternatives to

                    - Most European countries have laws that limit the collection

                <li>
                    - While we may not like the idea of others compiling dossiers
     on us, stopping them is an even worse situation. It gives
     the state the power to enter businesses, homes, and examine
     computers (else it is completely unenforceable). It creates
     ludicrous situations in which, say, someone making up a
     computerized list of their phone contacts is compiling an

     about this issue, and fail to realize that laws about
     privacy often take away the privacy rights of _others_.
     (Rights are rarely in conflict--contract plus self-privacy
     take care of 99% of situations where rights are purported
     to be in conflict.)

                    - many countries have adopted these data privacy laws,
     involving restrictions on the records that can be kept, the
     registration of things like mailing lists, and heavy
     penalties for those found keeping computer files deemed
     impermissable
                </li>

                    - this leads to invasions of privacy....this very Cypherpunks

     are obvious

                    - "There is a central contradiction running through the
     dabase regulations proposed by many so-called "privacy
     advocates".  To be enforceable they require massive
     government snooping into database activities on our
     workstatins and PCs,  especially the activities of many
     small at-home businesses (such as mailing list
     entrepreneurs who often work out of the home).
     
     "Thus, the upshot of these so-called "privacy" regulations
     is to destroy our last shreds of privacy against
     government, and calm us into blindly letting even more of
     the details of our personal lives into the mainframes of
     the major government agencies and credit reporting
     agenices, who if they aren't explicitly excepted from the
     privacy laws (as is common) can simply evade them by using
     offshore havesn, mutual agreements with foreign
     investigators, police and intelligence agencies."  [Jim

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Imagine that vehicle registrations require presentation of
     this card (gotta get those illegals out of their cars, or,
     more benignly, the bureaucracy simply makes the ID cars
     part of their process).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Instantly this makes those who refuse to get an ID card
     unable to get valid license tags. (Enforcement is already
     pretty good....I was pulled over a couple of times for
     either forgetting to put my new stickers on, or for driving
     with Oregon expired tags.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    + The "National Benefits Card," for example, is then required
     to get license plate tags.and maybe other things, like car
     and home insurance, etc. It would be very difficult to
     fight such a card, as one could not drive, could not pay
     taxes ("Awhh!" I hear you say, but consider the penalties,
     the tie-ins with employers, etc. You can run but you can't
     hide.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - the national ID card would presumably be tied in to
       income tax filings, in various ways I won't go into here.
       The Postal Service, aiming to get into this area I guess,
       has floated the idea of electronic filing, ID systems,
       etc.

                    - That some people will be able to skirt the system, or that
     the system will ultimately be unenforceable, does not
     lessen the concern. Things can get real tough in the
     meantime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - I see great dangers here, in tying a national ID card to
     transactions we are essentially unable to avoid in this
     society: driving, insurance (and let's not argue
     insurance...I mean it is unavoidable in the sense of legal
     issues, torts, etc.), border crossings, etc. Now how will
     one file taxes without such a card if one is made mandatory
     for interactions with the government? Saying "taxes are not
     collectable" is not an adequate answer. They may not be
     collectible for street punks and others who inhabit the
     underground economy, but they sure are for most of us.

                    - This question is debated a lot, and is important. Talk of a
     national ID card (what wags call an "internal passport") is
     in the air, as part of health care, welfare, and
     immigration legislation. Electronic markets make this also
     an issue for the ATM/smart card community. This is also
     closely tied in with the nature of anonymous reamailers
     (where physical identity is of course generally lacking).

                <li>
                    + First, "identity" can mean different things:

                        <li>
                            - Conventional View of Identity: Physical person, with
       birthdate, physical characteristics, fingerprints, social
       security numbers, passports, etc.--the whole cloud of
       "identity" items. (Biometric.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - Pseudonym View of Identity:  Persistent personnas,

                            - Most of us deal with identity as a mix of these views: we
       rarely check biometric credentials, but we also count on
       physical clues (voice, appearance, etc.). I assume that
       when I am speaking to "Duncan Frissell," whom I've never
       met in person, that he is indeed Duncan Frissell. (Some
       make the jump from this expectation to wanting the
       government enforce this claim, that is, provided I.D.)

       cash, a "validation" is given. No traceability exists.
       (There's a small chance that one driver can give his
       sticker to a new driver, and thus defraud the parking
       lot. This tends not to happen, due to the inconveniences
       of making a market in such stickers (coordinating with

       plates. Traceability is present, especially if the local
       parking lot is tied in to credit card companies, DMV,
       police, etc. (these link-ups are on the wish list of
       police agencies, to further "freeze out" fugitives, child

       the death of so many political ghouls would surely be

       (which can show some field, like age, without showing all
       fields, including name and such) out there. More
       radically, we need to cause people to question why
       credentials are as important as many people seem to

       it happened he was quite serious, at least appeared to
       be.  There was a long silence after he made the threat,
       with a staring contest.  He was quite intense.
       
       "I respect and trust the other two who were in the room
       (they were shocked and literally speechless, staring into
       their laps) and plan to ask NSA for a written apology and
       confirmation that he was not speaking for the agency.

        12.3. The Nature of Money
    </h4>


        <h5>
                12.3.1. The nature of money, of banking and finance, is a topic that suffuses most discussions of digital cash. Hardly surprising. But also an area that is even more detailed than is crypto. And endless confusion of terms, semantic quibblings on the list, and so on. I won't be devoting much space to trying to explain economics, banking, and the deep nature or money.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                12.3.2. There are of course many forms of cash or money today (these terms are not equivalent...)
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + coins, bills (presumed to be difficult to forge)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "ontological conservation laws"--the money can't be in
       two places at once, can't be double spent
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - this is only partly true, and forgery technology is
       making it all moot
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - diamonds, gold, works of art, etc. ("portable wealth")
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                12.3.3. Many forms of digital money. Just as there are dozens of major forms of instruments, so too will there be many forms of digital money. Niches will be filled.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                12.3.4. The deep nature of money is unclear to me. There are days when I think it's just a giant con game, with value in money only because others will accept it. Other days when I think it's somewhat tied to "real things" like gold and silver. And other days when I'm just unconcerned (so long as I have it, and it works).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                12.3.5. The digital cash discussions get similarly confused by the various ideas about money. Digital cash is not necessarily a form of _currency_, but is instead a transfer mechanism. More like a "digital check," in fact (though it may give rise to new currencies, or to wider use of some existing currency...at some point, it may become indistinguishable from a currency).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                12.3.6. I advise that people not worry overly much about the true and deep nature of money, and instead think about digital cash as a transfer protocol for some underlyng form of money, which might be gold coins, or Swiss francs, or chickens, or even giant stone wheels.

                12.3.7. Principle vs. Properties of Money

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Physical coins, as money, have certain basic properties:
     difficult to counterfeit, pointless to counterfeit if made
     of gold or silver, fungibility, immediate settling (no need
     to clear with a distant bank, no delays, etc.),
     untraceability, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Digital cash, in various flavors, has dramatically
     different properties, e.g., it may require clearing, any
     single digtital note is infinitely copyable, it may allow
     traceability, etc. A complicated mix of properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + But why is physical money (specie) the way it is? What
     properties account for this? What are the core principles
     that imply these properties?
                    <ul>

                    <ul>

                            - "Mike Ingle asks about digicash.  The simplest system I
       know of that is anonymous is the one by Chaum, Fiat, and
       Naor, which we have discussed here a few times.  The idea
       is that the bank chooses an RSA modulus, and a set of
       exponents e1, e2, e3, ..., where each exponent ei
       represents
       a denomination and possibly a date.  The exponents must
       be relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1).  PGP has a GCD routine
       which can be used to check for valid exponents..
       
       "As with RSA, to each public exponent ei corresponds a
       secret exponent di, calculated as the multiplicative
       inverse of ei mod (p-1)(q-1).  Again, PGP has a routine
       to calculate multiplicative inverses.
       
       "In this system, a piece of cash is a pair (x, f(x)^di),
       where f() is a one-way function.  MD5 would be a
       reasonable choice for f(), but notice that it produces a
       128-bit result.  f() should take this 128-bit output of
       MD5 and "reblock" it to be an multi-precision number by
       padding it; PGP has a "preblock" routine which does this,
       following the PKCS standard.
       
       "The way the process works, with the blinding, is like
       this.  The user chooses a random x.  This should probably
       be at least 64 or 128 bits, enough to preclude exhaustive
       search.  He calculates f(x), which is what he wants the
       bank to sign by raising to the power di.  But rather than
       sending f(x) to the bank directly, the user first blinds
       it by choosing a random number r, and calculating D=f(x)
       * r^ei.  (I should make it clear that ^ is the power
       operator, not xor.)  D is what he sends to the bank,
       along with some information about what ei is, which tells
       the denomination of the cash, and also information about
       his account number."  [Hal Finney, 1993-12-04]

     scenarios. Thinking about how to arrange off-line clearing,
     how to handle claims of people who claim their digital
     money was stolen, people who want various special kinds of
     services, such as receipts, and so on. It's an ecology
     here, not just a set of simple equations.

                    - Some approaches involve constantly-growing-in-size coins at
     each transfer, so who spent the money first can be deduced
     (or variants of this). And N. Ferguson developed a system
     allowing up to N expenditures of the same coin, where N is
     a parameter. [Howard Gayle reminded me of this, 1994-08-29]
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Why does everyone think that the law must immediately be
     invoked when double spending is detected?....Double
     spending is an informational property of digital cash
     systems. Need we find malicious intent in a formal
     property?  The obvious moralism about the law and double
     spenders is inappropriate.  It evokes images of revenge and
     retribution, which are stupid, not to mention of negative
     economic value." [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-27]  (This also
     relates to Eric's good point that we too often frame crypto
     issue in terms of loaded terms like "cheating," "spoofing,"
     and "enemies," when more neutral terms would carry less
     meaning-obscuring baggage and would not give our "enemies"
     (:-}) the ammunition to pass laws based on such terms.)

                        <li>
                            - Chaum went to great lengths to develop system which
       preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but
       which break anonymity and thus reveal identity for double-
       spending instances. I'm not sure what market forces
       caused him to think about this as being so important, but
       it creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it
       require physical ID, it invokes a legal system to try to
       collect from "double spenders," and it admits the
       extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings.
       For example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then quickly
       Alice spends that money before Bob can...Bob is then
       revealed as a "double spender," and his identity revealed
       to whomver wanted it...Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very
       broken idea. Acceptable mainly for small transactions.

                        <li>
                            - I favor on-line clearing. Simply put: the first spending
       is the only spending. The guy who gets to the train
       locker where the cash is stored is the guy who gets it.
       This ensure that the burden of maintaining the secret is
       on the secret holder.

                            - When Alice and Bob transfer money, Alice makes the
       transfer, Bob confirms it as valid (or verifies that his
       bank has received the deposit), and the transaction is
       complete.

                        <li>
                            - With network speeds increasing dramatically, on-line
       clearing should be feasible for most transactions. Off-
       line systems may of course be useful, especially for
       small transactions, the ones now handled with coins and
       small bills.

                12.6.7. "How does on-line clearing of anonymous digital cash work?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - There's a lot of math connected with blinding,
     exponentions, etc. See Schneier's book for an introduction,
     or the various papers of Chaum, Brands, Bos, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - On-line clearing is similar to two parties in a transaction
     exchanging goods and money. The transaction is clearled
     locally, and immediately. Or they could arrange transfer of
     funds at a bank, and the banker could tell them over the
     phone that the transaction has cleared--true "on-line
     clearing." Debit cards work this way, with money
     transferred effectively immediately out of one account and
     into another. Credit cards have some additional wrinkles,
     such as the credit aspect, but are basically still on-line
     clearing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Conceptually, the guiding principle idea is simple: he who
     gets to the train locker where the cash is stored *first*
     gets the cash. There can never be "double spending," only
     people who get to the locker and find no cash inside.
     Chaumian blinding allows the "train locker" (e.g., Credit
     Suisse) to give the money to the entity making the claim
     without knowing how the number correlates to previous
     numbers they "sold" to other entities. Anonymity is
     preserved, absolutely. (Ignoring for this discussion issues
     of cameras watching the cash pickup, if it ever actually
     gets picked up.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Once the "handshaking" of on-line clearing is accepted,
     based on the "first to the money gets it" principle, then
     networks of such clearinghouses can thrive, as each is
     confident about clearing. (There are some important things
     needed to provide what I'll dub "closure" to the circuit.
     People need to ping the system, depositing and withdrawing,
     to establish both confidence and cover. A lot like remailer
     networks. In fact, very much like them.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - In on-line clearing, only a number is needed to make a
     transfer. Conceptually, that is. Just a number. It is up to
     the holder of the number to protect it carefully, which is
     as it should be (for reasons of locality, or self-
     responsibility, and because any other option introduces
     repudiation, disavowal, and the "Twinkies made me do it"
     sorts of nonsense). Once the number is transferred and
     reblinded, the old number no longer has a claim on the
     money stored at Credit Suisse, for example. That money is
     now out of the train locker and into a new one. (People
     always ask, "But where is the money, really?" I see digital
     cash as *claims* on accounts in existing money-holding
     places, typically banks. There are all kinds of "claims"--
     Eric Hughes has regaled us with tales of his explorations
     of the world of commericial paper. My use of the term
     "claim" here is of the "You present the right number, you
     get access" kind. Like the combination to a safe. The train
     locker idea makes this clearer, and gets around the
     confusion about "digimarks" of "e$" actually _being_ any
     kind of money it and of itself.)

       main uses (others being the advancing of actual credit,
       ignored here). In fact, secured credit cards and debit
       cards don't offer this advancement of credit, but are
       mainly used to accrue the "order by phone" and "avoid

     something to say about this, and there may be various
     roadblocks in the way. It might be best to buy off the VISA
     and MasterCard folks by working through them. (And they

       "NetCash is a framework that supports realtime electronic
       payments with provision of anonymity over an unsecure
       network.  It is designed to enable new types of services
       on the Internet which have not been practical to date
       because of the absence of a secure, scalable, potentially
       anonymous payment method.
       
       "NetCash strikes a balance between unconditionally
       anonymous electronic currency, and signed instruments
       analogous to checks that are more scalable but identify
       the principals in a transaction.  It does this by
       providing the framework within which proposed electronic
       currency protocols can be integrated with the scalable,
       but non-anonymous, electronic banking infrastructure that
       has been proposed for routine transactions."

       Cashless World. The Washington Post, April 03, 1994,
       FINAL Edition By: Albert B. Crenshaw, Washington Post ...
       
       "Now that credit cards are in the hands of virtually
       every living, breathing adult  in  the  country-not to
       mention a lot of children and the occasional family  pet-
       and  now  that  almost  as  many people  have  ATM cards,
       card companies are wondering where future growth will
       come from.
       
       "At *Visa* International, the answer is: Replace cash
       with plastic.
       
       "Last month,  the  giant  association  of  card issuers
       announced it had formed a coalition of banking and
       technology companies to develop technical standards  for
       a  product it dubbed the "Electronic Purse," a plastic
       card meant to replace coins and bills in small
       transactions."  [provided by Duncan Frissell, 1994-04-05]

       International and the Usual Suspects suggest
       identity-blinding protocols are not in use. I also see no
       mention of DigiCash, or even RSA (but maybe I missed that-
       -and the presence of RSA would not necessairly mean
       identity-blinding protocols were being planned).
       
       Likely Scenario: This is *not* digital cash as we think
       of it. Rather, this is a future evolution of the cash ATM
       card and credit card, optimized for faster and cheaper
       clearing.
       
       Scary Scenario: This could be the vehicle for the long-
       rumored "banning of cash." (Just because conspiracy
       theorists and Number of the Beast Xtian fundamentalists
       belive it doesn't render it implausible.)

       anonymity. Make no mistake, this is not the digital cash
       that Cypherpunks espouse. This gives the credit agencies
       and the government (the two work hand in hand) complete
       traceability of all purchases, automatic reporting of
       spending patterns, target lists for those who frequent
       about-to-be-outlawed businesses, and invasive
       surveillance of all inter-personal economic transactions.
       This is the AntiCash. Beware the Number of the AntiCash.

     violate their customer's privacy, the confiscation of BBS
     operators who stray outside the laws of some jurisdication

     Hughes spent a lot of time reading up on the laws regarding

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Hasn't been finished. Protocols are still being researched,
     papers are still being published. In any single area, such
     as toll road payments, it may  be possible to deploy an
     application-specific system, but there is no "general"
     solution (yet). There is no "digital coin" or unforgeable
     object representing value, so the digital money area is
     more similar to the similarly nonsimple markets in
     financial instruments, commercial papers, bonds, warrants,
     checks, etc. (Areas that are not inherently simple and that
     have required lots of computerization and communications to
     make manageable.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Flakiness of Nets. Systems crash, mail gets delayed
     inexplicably, subscriptions to lists get lunched, and all
     sorts of other breakages occur. Most interaction on the
     Nets involves a fair amount of human adaptation to changing
     conditions, screwups, workarounds, etc. These are not
     conditions that inspire confidence in automated money
     systems!
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Hard to Use. Few people will use systems that require
     generating code, clients, etc. Semantic gap (generating
     stuff on a Unix workstation is not at all like taking one's
     checkbook out). Protocols in crypto are generally hard to
     use and confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Lack of compelling need. Although people have tried various
     experiments with digital money tokens or coupons (Magic
     Money/Tacky Tokens, the HeX market, etc.), there is little
     real world incentive to experiment with them. And most of
     the denominated tokens are for truly trivial amounts of
     money, not for anything worth spending time learning. No
     marketplace for buyers to "wander around in." (You don't
     buy what you don't see.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Legal issues. The IRS does not look favorably on
     alternative currencies, especially if used in attempts to
     bypass ordinary tax collection schemes. This and related
     legal issues (redemptions into dollars) put a roadblock in
     front of serious plans to use digital money.

                        <li>
                            - lack of robustness and completeness in the various
       protocols: they are "not ready for prime time" in most
       cases (PGP is solid, and some good shells exist for PGP,
       but the many other crypto protocols are mostly not
       implemented at all, at least not widely).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            + The Net runs "open-loop," as a store-and-forward delivery
       system

                                    - The Net is mostly a store-and-forward netword, at least
         at the granularity seen by the user in sending
         messages, and hence is "open loop." Messages may or may
         not be received in a timely way, and there is little
         opportunity for negotiaton on a real-time basis.

                                    - This open-loop nature usually works...messages get
         through most of the time. And the "message in a bottle"
         nature fits in with anonymous remailers (with
         latency/delay), with message pools, and with other
         schemes to make traffic analysis harder. A "closed-
         loop," responsive system is likelier to be traffic-
         analyzed by correlation of packets, etc.

                12.10.7. Scenario for deployment of digital cash
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Eric Hughes has spent time looking into this. Too many
     issues to go into here, but he had this interesting
     scenario, repeated almost in toto here:
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "It's very unlikely that a USA bank will be the one to
     deploy anonymous digital dollars first.  It's much more
     likely that the first dollar digital cash will be issued
     overseas, possibly London.  By the same token, the non-
     dollar regulation on banks in this country is not the same
     as the dollar regulation, so it's quite possible that the
     New York banks may be the first issuers of digital cash, in
     pounds sterling, say.
     
     "There will be two stages in actually deploying digital
     cash.  By digital cash, here, I mean a retail phenomenon,
     available anybody. The first will be to digitize money, and
     the second will be to anonymize it.  Efforts are already
     well underway to make more-or-less secure digital funds
     transfers with reasonably low transaction fees (not
     transaction costs, which are much more than just fees).
     These efforts, as long as they retain some traceability,
     will almost certainly succeed first in the marketplace,
     because (and this is vital) the regulatory environment
     against anonymity is not compromised.
     
     "Once, however, money has been digitized, one of the
     services available for purchase can be the anonymous
     transfer of funds.  I expect that the first digitization of
     money won't be fully fungible.  For example, if you allow
     me to take money out of your checking account by automatic
     debit, there is risk that the money won't be there when I
     ask for it.  Therefore that kind of money won't be
     completely fungible, because money authorized from one
     person won't be completely identical with money from
     another.  It may be a risk issue, it may be a timeliness
     issue, it may be a fee issue; I don't know, but it's
     unlikely to be perfect.
     
     "Now, as the characteristic size of a business decreases,
     the relative costs of dealing with whatever imperfection
     there is will be greater. To wit, the small player will
     still have some problem getting paid, although certainly
     less than now.  Digital cash solves many of these problems.
     The clearing is immediate and final (no transaction
     reversals).  The number of entities to deal with is greatly
     reduced, hopefully to one.  The need and risk and cost of
     accounts receivables is eliminated.  It's anonymous.  There
     will be services which will desire these advantages, enough
     to support a digital cash infrastructure. [Eric Hughes,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "Magic Money is a digital cash system designed for use over
     electronic mail. The system is online and untraceable.
     Online means that each transaction involves an exchange
     with a server, to prevent double-spending. Untraceable
     means that it is impossible for anyone to trace
     transactions, or to match a withdrawal with a deposit, or
     to match two coins in any way."
     
     "The system consists of two modules, the server and the
     client. Magic Money uses the PGP ascii-armored message
     format for all communication between the server and client.
     All traffic is encrypted, and messages from the server to
     the client are signed. Untraceability is provided by a
     Chaum-style blind signature. Note that the blind signature
     is patented, as is RSA. Using it for experimental purposes
     only shouldn't get you in trouble.
     
     "Digicash is represented by discrete coins, the
     denominations of which are chosen by the server operator.
     Coins are RSA-signed, with a different e/d pair for each
     denomination. The server does not store any money. All
     coins are stored by the client module. The server accepts
     old coins and blind- signs new coins, and checks off the
     old ones on a spent list."

                <li>
                    - No, not if the cash outlook is taken. Cash is cash. Caveat

                <li>
                    - The "first to the locker" approach causes the bank not to
     particularly care about this, just as a Swiss bank will
     allow access to a numbered account by presentation of the
     number, and perhaps a key. Identity proof *may* be needed,
     depending on the "protocol" they and the customer
     established, but it need not be. And the last thing the
     bank is worried about is being able to "find and prosecute"
     anyone, as there is no way they can be liable for a double
     spending incident. The beauties of local clearing! (Which
     is what gold coins do, and paper money if we really think
     we can pass it on to others.)

     digital cash.

                <li>
                    - This comes up a lot, with people in Net newsgroups even
     warning others not to use digital cash because of the ease
     of traceability. Not so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Not the kind proposed by David Chaum and his colleagues in
     the Netherlands. The whole thrust of their research over
     the last decade has been the use of cryptographic
     techniques to make electronic transactions secure from
     fraud while at the same time protecting personal privacy.
     They, and others, have developed a number of schemes for
     UNTRACEABLE digital cash." [Kevin Van Horn,

            <ul>

     People can store key numbers with people they trust,
     perhaps encrypted with other keys, can leave them with
     their lawyers, etc. All sorts of arrangements can be made.
     Personal identification is but one of these arrangements.
     Often used, but not essential to the underlyng protocol.
     Again, the Swiss banks (maybe now the Liechtenstein
     anstalts are a better example) don't require physical ID
     for all accounts. (More generally, if Charles wants to
     create a bank in which deposits are made and then given out
     to the first person who sings the right tune, why should we
     care? This extreme example is useful in pointing out that
     _contractual arrangements_ need not involve governmental or
     societal norms about what constitutes proof of identity.)

     would've rejected such a thing. Too many memories of

     Americans (and Europeans) are so used to producing
     documents for every transaction, and so used to using VISA
     cards and ATM cards at gas stations, supermarkets, and even
     at flea markets, that they'll willingly--even eagerly--
     adopt such a system.

        <h5>
                12.16.1. Encrypted open books, or anonymous auditing
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Eric Hughes has worked on a scheme using a kind of blinding
     to do "encrypted open books," whereby observers can verify
     that a bank is balancing its books without more detailed
     looks at individual accounts. (I have my doubts about
     spoofs, attacks, etc., but such are always to be considered
     in any new protocol.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Kent Hastings wondered how an offshore bank could provide
     assurances to depositors.  I wondered the same thing a few
     months ago, and started working on what Perry calls the
     anonymous auditing problem.  I have what I consider to be
     the core of a solution.
     ...The following is long.... [TCM Note: Too long to include
     here. I am including just enough to convince readers that
     some new sorts of banking ideas may come out of
     cryptography.]
     
     "If we use the contents of the encrypted books at the
     organizational boundary points to create suitable legal
     opbligations, we can mostly ignore what goes on inside of
     the mess of random numbers.  That is, even if double books
     were being kept, the legal obligations created should
     suffice to ensure that everything can be unwound if needed.
     This doesn't prevent networks of corrupt businesses from
     going down all at once, but it does allow networks of
     honest businesses to operate with more assurance of
     honesty." [Eric Hughes,  PROTOCOL: Encrypted Open Books,
     1993-08-16]

                <li>
                    - Even a small involvement, through special regulations,
     granted frachises, etc., produces vested interests. For
     example, those in a community who had to wait to get
     building permits want _others_ to wait just as long, or
     longer. Or, businesses that had to meet certain standard,
     even if unreasonable, will demand that new businesses do so
     also. The effect is an ever-widening tar pit of rules,
     restrictions, and delays. Distortions of the market result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Look at how hard it is for the former U.S.S.R. to
     disentangle itself from 75 years of central planning. They
     are now an almost totally Mafia-controlled state (by this I
     mean that "privatization" of formerly non-private
     enterprises benefitted those who had amassed money and
     influence, and that these were mainly the Russian Mafia and
     former or current politicians...the repercussions of this
     "corrupt giveaway" will be felt for decades to come).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - An encouraging sign: The thriving black market in Russia-
       -which all Cypherpunks of course cheer--will gradually
       displace the old business systems with new ones, as in
       all economies. Eventually the corruptly-bought businesses
       will sink or swim based on merit, and newly-created
       enterprises will compete with them.

        <h5>
                12.17.2. "Purist" Approach to Keys, Cash, Responsibility
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + There are two main approaches to the issue:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - Key owner is responsible for uses of his key
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - or, Others are responsible
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - could involve their bank holding keys, or escrow agents
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - or n-out-of-m voting systems
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And locality--who better to keep keys secure than the
     owner? Anything that transfers blame to "the banks" or to
     "society" breaks the feedback loop of responsibility,
     provides an "out" for the lazy, and encourages fraud
     (people who disavow contracts by claiming their key was
     stolen).

        13.3. Activism is a Tough Job
    </h4>


        <h5>
                13.3.1. "herding cats"..trying to change the world through exhortation seems a particulary ineffective notion
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.3.2. There's always been a lot of wasted time and rhetoric on the Cypherpunks list as various people tried to get others to follow their lead, to adopt their vision. (Nothing wrong with this, if done properly. If someone leads by example, or has a particularly compelling vision or plan, this may naturally happen. Too often, though, the situation was that someone's vague plans for a product were declared by them to be the standards that others should follow. Various schemes for digital money, in many forms and modes, has always been the prime example of this.)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.3.3. This is related also to what Kevin Kelley calls "the fax effect." When few people own fax machines, they're not of much use. Trying to get others to use the same tools one has is like trying to convince people to buy fax machines so that you can communicate by fax with them...it may happen, but probably for other reasons. (Happily, the interoperability of PGP provided a common communications medium that had been lacking with previous platform-specific cipher programs.)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.3.4. Utopian schemes are also a tough sell. Schemes about using digital money to make inflation impossible, schemes to collect taxes with anonymous systems, etc.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.3.5. Harry Browne's "How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World" is well worth reading; he advises against getting upset and frustrated that the world is not moving in the direction one would like.

                    - Always a key part--perhaps _the_ key part--of Cypherpunks
     activity. "Cypherpunks write code." From work on PGP to
     remailers to crypto toolkits to FOIA requests, and a bunch
     of other things, Cypherpunks hack the system in various
     ways.

     Wayner's articles....all are examples. (Many Cypherpunks
     projects are also done, or primarily done, for other
     reasons, so we cannot in all cases claim credit for this
     work.)

         several times since I first wrote it in mid-1992. In
         fact, I first posted it on the "Extropians" mailing

                                    - Three Cypherpunks are having dinner, perhaps in Palo
         Alto. Their waiter tells them that their bill has
         already been paid, either by the NSA or by one of them.
         The waiter won't say more. The Cypherpunks wish to know
         whether one of them paid, or the NSA paid. But they
         don't want to be impolite and force the Cypherpunk
         payer to 'fess up, so they carry out this protocol (or
         procedure):
         
         Each Cypherpunk flips a fair coin behind a menu placed
         upright between himself and the Cypherpunk on his
         right. The coin is visible to himself AND to the
         Cypherpunk on his left. Each Cypherpunk can see his own
         coin and the coin to his right. (STOP RIGHT HERE!
         Please take the time to make a sketch of the situation
         I've described. If you lost it here, all that follows
         will be a blur. It's too bad the state of the Net today
         cannot support figures and diagrams easily.)
         
         Each Cypherpunk then states out loud whether the two
         coins he can see are the SAME or are DIFFERENT, e.g.,
         "Heads-Tails" means DIFFERENT, and so forth. For now,
         assume the Cypherpunks are truthful. A little bit of
         thinking shows that the total number of "DIFFERENCES"
         must be either 0 (the coins all came up the same), or
         2. Odd parity is impossible.
         
         Now the Cypherpunks agree that if one of them paid, he
         or she will SAY THE OPPOSITE of what they actually see.
         Remember, they don't announce what their coin turned up
         as, only whether it was the same or different as their
         neighbor.
         
         Suppose none of them paid, i.e., the NSA paid. Then
         they all report the truth and the parity is even
         (either 0 or 2 differences). They then know the NSA
         paid.
         
         Suppose one of them paid the bill. He reports the
         opposite of what he actually sees, and the parity is
         suddenly odd. That is, there is 1 difference reported.
         The Cypherpunks now know that one of them paid. But can
         they determine which one?
         
         Suppose you are one of the Cypherpunks and you know you
         didn't pay. One of the other two did. You either
         reported SAME or DIFFERENT, based on what your neighbor
         to the right (whose coin you can see) had. But you
         can't tell which of the other two is lying! (You can
         see you right-hand neighbor's coin, but you can't see
         the coin he sees to his right!)
         
         This all generalizes to any number of people. If none
         of them paid, the parity is even. If one of them paid,
         the parity is odd. But which one of them paid cannot be
         deduced. And it should be clear that each round can
         transmit a bit, e.g., "I paid" is a "1". The message
         "Attack at dawn" could thus be "sent" untraceably with
         multiple rounds of the protocol.

                                    - The "Crypto Ouija Board": I explain this to people as a
         kind of ouija board. A message, like "I paid" or a more
         interesting "Transfer funds from.....," just "emerges"
         out of the group, with no means of knowing where it
         came from. Truly astounding.

                                    - In Chaum's paper, the explanation above is given
         quickly, in a few pages. The _rest_ of the paper is
         then devoted to dealing with the many "gotchas" and
         attacks that come up and that must be dealt with before
         the DC protocol is even remotely possible. I think all
         those interested in protocol design should read this
         paper, and the follow-on papers by Bos, Pfitzmann,
         etc., as object lessons for dealing with complex crypto
         protocols.

                                            - 1. Collusion. Obviously the Cypherpunks can collude
           to deduce the payer. This is best dealt with by
           creating multiple subcircuits (groups doing the
           protocol amongst themselves). Lots more stuff here.
           Chaum devotes most of the paper to these kind of
           issues and their solutions.
           
           2. With each round of this protocol, a single bit is
           transmitted. Sending a long message means many coin
           flips. Instead of coins and menus, the neighbors
           would exchange lists of random numbers (with the
           right partners, as per the protocol above, of course.
           Details are easy to figure out.)
           
           3. Since the lists are essentially one-time pads, the
           protocol is unconditionally secure, i.e., no
           assumptions are made about the difficulty of
           factoring large numbers or any other crypto
           assumptions.
           
           4. Participants in such a "DC-Net" (and here we are
           coming to the heart of the "crypto anarchy" idea)
           could exchange CD-ROMs or DATs, giving them enough
           "coin flips" for zillions of messages, all
           untraceable! The logistics are not simple, but one
           can imagine personal devices, like smart card or
           Apple "Newtons," that can handle these protocols
           (early applications may be for untraceable
           brainstorming comments, secure voting in corportate
           settings, etc.)
           
           5. The lists of random numbers (coin flips) can be
           generated with standard cryptographic methods,
           requiring only a key to be exchanged between the
           appropriate participants. This eliminates the need
           for the one-time pad, but means the method is now
           only cryptographically secure, which is often
           sufficient. (Don't think "only cryptographically
           secure" means insecure....the messages may remain
           encrypted for the next billion years)
           
           6. Collisions occur when multiple messages are sent
           at the same time. Various schemes can be devised to
           handle this, like backing off when you detect another
           sender (when even parity is seen instead of odd
           parity). In large systems this is likely to be a
           problem. Deliberate disruption, or spamming, is a
           major problem--a disruptor can shut down the DC-net
           by sending bits out. As with remailes, anonymity
           means freedom from detection. (Anonymous payments to
           send a message may help, but the details are murky to
           me.)

         Think for a few minutes about this and you'll see the

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Reaction has already been largely favorable. Journalists
     such as Steven Levy, Kevin Kelly, John Markoff, and Julian
     Dibbell have written favorably. Reaction of people I have
     talked to has also been mostly favorable.

                13.5.2. "What are the likely attitudes toward the more outre projects, such as digital money, crypto anarchy, data havens, and the like?"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Consternation is often met. People are frightened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The journalists who have written about these things (those
     mentioned above) have gotten beyond the initial reaction
     and seem genuinely intrigued  by the changes that are
     coming.

        <h5>
                13.5.3. "What kinds of _attacks_ can we expect?"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + Depends on the projects, but some general sorts of attacks
     are likely. Some have already occurred. Examples:
    * flooding of remailers, denial of service attacks--to
       swamp systems and force remailers to reconsider
       operations
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    - this is fixed (mostly) with "digital postage" (if
         postage covers costs, and generates a profit, then the
         more the better)
    * deliberately illegal or malicicious messages, such as
       death threats
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - designed to put legal and sysop pressures on the
         remailer operator
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - several remailers have been attacked this way, or at
         least have had these messages
                                </li>

                                    - source-blocking sometimes works, though not of course
         if another remailer is first used (many issues here)
    * prosecution for content of posts
                                </li>

     major role--perhaps the dominant role--in generating scorn
     for Clipper. In many way the themes debated here on the Net
     have tremendous influence on media reaction, on editorials,
     on organizational reactions, and of course on the opinion
     of technical folks. News spreads quickly, zillions of
     theories are aired and debated, and consensus tends to

                13.6.5. Crypto faces the complexity barrier that all technologies face
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Life has gotten more complicated in some ways, simpler in
     other ways (we don't have to think about cooking, about
     shoeing the horses, about the weather, etc.). Crypto is
     currently fairly complicated, especially if multiple
     paradigms are used (encryption, signing, money, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - As a personal note, I'm practically drowning in a.c.
     adaptors and power cords for computers, laser printers,
     VCRs, camcorders, portable stereos, laptop computers,
     guitars, etc. Everything with a rechargeable battery has to
     be charged, but not overcharged, and not allowed to run-
     down...I forgot to plug in my old Powerbook 100 for a
     couple of months, and the lead-acid batteries went out on
     me. Personally, I'm drowning in this crap.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - I mention this only because I sense a backlash
     coming...people will say "screw it" to new technology that
     actually complicates their lives more than it simplifies
     their lives. "Crypto tweaks" who like to fool around with
     "creating a client" in order to play with digital cash will
     continue to do so, but 99% of the sought-after users won't.
     (A nation that can't--or won't--set its VCR clock will
     hardly embrace the complexities of digital cash. Unless
     things change, and use becomes as easy as using an ATM.)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Fact is, most people never think about real security. Safe
     manufacturers have said that improvements in safes were
     driven by insurance rates. A direct incentive to spend more
     money to improve security (cost of better safe &lt; cost of
     higher insurance rate).
     
     Right now there is almost no economic incentive for people
     to worry about PIN security, about protecting their files,
     etc. (Banks eat the costs and pass them on...any bank which
     tried to save a few bucks in losses by requiring 10-digit
     PINs--which people would *write down* anyway!--would lose
     customers. Holograms and pictures on bank cards are
     happening because the costs have dropped enough.)
     
     Personally, my main interests is in ensuring the Feds don't
     tell me I can't have as much security as I want to buy. I
     don't share the concern quoted above that we have to find
     ways to give other people security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Others disagree with my nonchalance, pointing out that
     getting lots of other people to use crypto makes it easier
     for those who already protect themselves. I agree, I just
     don't focus on missionary work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - For those so inclined, point out to people how vulnerable
     their files are, how the NSA can monitor the Net, and so
     on. All the usual scare stories.

    </h4>


        <h5>
                13.10.1. The backroom deals in Washington are flying...apparently the Administration got burned by the Clipper fiasco (which they could partly write-off as being a leftover from the Bush era) and is now trying to "work the issues" behind the scenes before unveiling new and wide-reaching programs. (Though at this writing, the Health Bill is looking mighty amateurish and seems ulikely to pass.)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.10.2. We are not hearing about these "deals" in a timely way. I first heard that a brand new, and "in the bag," deal was cooking when I was talking to a noted journalist. He told me that a new deal, cut between Congress, the telecom industry, and the EFF-type lobbying groups, was already a done deal and would be unveiled so. Sure enough, the New and Improved Digital Telephony II Bill appears a few weeks later and is said by EFF representatives to be unstoppable. [comments by S. McLandisht and others, comp.org.eff.talk, 1994-08]

        <h5>
                13.10.4. I've announced that I won't be renewing my EFF membership. I don't expect them to fight all battles, to win all wars, but I sure as hell won't help *pay* for their backrooms deals with the telcos.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                13.10.5. This may me in trouble with my remaining friends at the EFF, but it's as if a lobbying groups in Germany saw the handwriting on the wall about the Final Solution, deemed it essentially unstoppable, and so sent their leaders to Berchtesgaden/Camp David to make sure that the death of the Jews was made as painless as possible. A kind of joint Administration/Telco/SS/IG Farben "compromise." While I don't equate Mitch, Jerry, Mike, Stanton, and others with Hitler's minions, I certainly do think the inside-the-Beltway dealmaking is truly disgusting.

                    + As Eric Hughes put it,  "paranoia is cryptography's
     occupational hazard."
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - "The effect of paranoia is self-delusion of the following
       form--that one's possible explanations are skewed toward
       malicious attacks, by individuals, that one has the
       technical knowledge to anticipate.  This skewing creates
       an inefficient allocation of mental energy, it tends
       toward the personal, downplaying the possibility of
       technical error, and it begins to close off examination
       of technicalities not fully understood.
       
       "Those who resist paranoia will become better at
       cryptography than those who do not, all other things
       being equal.  Cryptography is about epistemology, that
       is, assurances of truth, and only secondarily about
       ontology, that is, what actually is true.  The goal of
       cryptography is to create an accurate confidence that a
       system is private and secure. In order to create that
       confidence, the system must actually be secure, but
       security is not sufficient.  There must be confidence
       thatthe way by which this security becomes to be believed
       is robust and immune to delusion.
       
       "Paranoia creates delusion.  As a direct and fundamental
       result, it makes one worse at cryptography.  At the
       outside best, it makes one slower, as the misallocation
       of attention leads one down false trails. Who has the
       excess brainpower for that waste?  Certainly not I.  At
       the worst, paranoia makes one completely ineffective, not
       only in technical means but even more so in the social
       context in which cryptography is necessarily relevant."

                    + An example: A restaurant offers to replace dropped items
     (dropped on the floor, literally) for free...a reasonable
     thing to offer customers (something I see frequently). So
     why not make it the law? Because then the reasonable
     discretion of the restaurant owner would be lost, and some
     customers could "game against" (exploit the letter of the
     law) the system. Even threaten lawsuits.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - (And libertarians know that "my house, my rules" applies
       to restaurants and other businesses, absent a contract
       spelling exceptions out.)

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And when "reasonableness" is enforced by law, the game-
     playing increases. In effect, some discretion is needed to
     reject claims that are based on gaming. Markets naturally
     work this way, as no "basic rights" or contracts are being
     violated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Fortunately, strong crypto makes this nonsense impossible.
     Perforce, people will engage in contracts only voluntarily.

                </li>
                <li>
                    - No, because the way agreement is sort of reached is through
     standards or examplars that people can get behind. Thus, we
     don't get "consensus" in advance on the taste of Coca
     Cola...somebody offers Coke for sale and then the rest is
     history.

                    - PGP is a more relevant example. The examplar is on a "take
     it or leave it" basis, with minor improvements made by
     others, but within the basic format.

                14.3.1. digital timestamping

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The canonical reference for digital timestamping is the
     work of Stu Haber and Scott Stornetta, of Bellcore. Papers
     presented at various Crypto conferences. Their work
     involves having the user compute a hash of the document he
     wishes to be stamped and sending the hash to them, where
     they merge this hash with other hashes (and all previous
     hashes, via a tree system) and then they *publish* the
     resultant hash in a very public and hard-to-alter forum,
     such as in an ad in the Sunday "New York Times."
     
     In their parlance, such an ad is a "widely witnessed
     event," and attempts to alter all or even many copies of
     the newspaper would be very difficult and expensive. (In a

       or keys and is instructed to release them at some future
       time. (The key-holding agents need not be lawyers, of

         secrets of various kinds, and any system based on
         cryptography needs to compete strongly with this simple
         to use, well-established system.

         subpoenaed. Depends on jurisdictional issues, future

         lawyer cannot be reached. All that is know, for
         example, is that "somewhere out there" is an agent who
         is holding the key(s). Reputation-based systems should
         work well here: the agent gains little and loses a lot
         by releasing a key early, hence has no economic
         motivation to do so. (Picture also a lot of "pinging"
         going to "rate" the various ti&lt;w agents.)

         This is fraught with problems, including

         timing of release, and general clumsiness. As Hal
         Finney notes:

                                            - "There was an talk on this topic at either the Crypto
           92 or 93 conference, I forget which.  It is available
           in the proceedings....The method used was similar to
           the idea here of encrypting with a public key and
           requiring factoring of the modulus to decrypt.  But
           the author had more techniques he used, iterating
           functions forward which would take longer to iterate
           backwards.  The purpose was to give a more
           predictable time to decrypt.....One problem with this
           is that it does not so much put a time floor on the
           decryption, but rather a cost floor.  Someone who is
           willing to spend enough can decrypt faster than
           someone who spends less.  Another problem is the
           difficulty of forecasting the growth of computational
           power per dollar in the future." [Hal Finney,

     he should try desteganizing and decrypting the message, and
     the other is for a possible attacker to discover illegal
     uses of cryptography.
     
     "Steganography should be used with a "stealthy"
     cryptosystem (secret key or public key), one in which the
     cyphertext is indistinguishable from a random bit string.
     You would not want it to have any headers which could be
     used to confirm that a desteganized message was other than
     random noise." [Hal Finney, 1993-05-25]

                14.7.4. I described it in 1988 or 89 and many times since
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Several years ago I posted to sci.crypt my "novel" idea for
     packing bits into the essentially inaudible "least
     significant bits" (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as
     DATs and CDs. Ditto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24-
     bit color image. I've since seen this idea reinvented
     _several_ times on sci.crypt and elsewhere...and I'm
     willing to bet I wasn't the first, either (so I don't claim
     any credit).
     
     A 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr
     x 2 channels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about
     1.2 Gbytes. A CD contains about half this, i.e., about 700
     Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is 1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80
     Mbytes. This is a _lot_ of storage!
     
     A home-recorded DAT--and I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to
     make tapes--has so much noise down at the LSB level--noise
     from the A/D and D/A converters, noise from the microphones
     (if any), etc.--that the bits are essentially random at
     this level. (This is a subtle, but important, point: a
     factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined bits at
     all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot
     any modifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will
     of course not be subject to this kind of analysis.) Some
     care might be taken to ensure that the statistical
     properties of the signal bits resemble what would be
     expected with "noise" bits, but this will be a minor
     hurdle.
     
     Adobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in
     the "noise" that dominates things down at the LSB level.
     The resulting GIF can then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed.
     Ditto for sound samples, using the ideas I just described
     (but typically requiring sound sampling boards, etc.). I've
     done some experiments along these lines.
     
     This doesn't mean our problems are solved, of course.
     Exchanging tapes is cumbersome and vulnerable to stings.
     But it does help to point out the utter futility of trying
     to stop the flow of bits.

    <h4>
        15.3. The Nature of Reputations
    </h4>


        <h5>
                15.3.1. The claim by many of us that "reputations" will take care of many problems in crypto anarchic markets is disputed by some (notably Eric Hughes). To be sure, it will not be a trivial issue. Institutions take years or decades to evolve.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                15.3.2. However, think of how often we use reputations: friends, books, movies, restaurants, etc
        </h5>

        <h5>
                15.3.3. Reputations and other institutions will take time to evolve. Saying "the market will talke care of things" may be true, but this may take time. The "invisible hand" doesn't necessarily move swiftly.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                15.3.4. "What are 'reputations' and why are they so important?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - a vague concept related to degree of believability, of
     trust, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + "we know it when we see it"
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - (sorry for the cop out, but I don't have a good
       definition handy....James Donald says studying reputatons
       is "nominalist hot air" [1994-09-02], but I think it's
       quite important)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>

                            - reputation-based systems
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - escrow, expectations
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - "reputation capital"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - like book or music recommendations
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - web of trust (is different than just "trust"---tensor,
       rather than scalar)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - we mentally downcheck and upcheck on the basis of
       experience; we learn

                    </ul>

                15.3.5. "How are reputations acquired, ruined, transferred, etc.?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + First, reputations are not "owned" by the person to whom
     they are attached by others
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            + the algebra is tricky...maybe Eric Hughes or one of the
       other pure math types can help straighten out the
       "calculus of reputations"
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    - reputations are not symmetric: just because Alice
         esteems Bob does mean the reverse is so
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - reputations are not transitive, though they are
         partially transitive: if Alice esteems Bob and Bob
         esteems Charles, this may cause Alice to be somewhat
         more esteemful of Charles.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - a tensor matrix?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    - a graph?
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            - in praise or criticism of another agent
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - in reviews (think of Siskel and Ebert "spending" some of
       their reputation capital in the praise of a movie, and
       how their own reptutations will go up and down as a
       function of many things, including especially how much
       the viewing audience agrees with them)
                        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Of course not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And Eric Hughes has in the past said that too much
     importance is being invested in this idea of reputations,
     though many or even most of us (who comment on the matter)
     clearly think otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - In any case, much more study is needed. Hal Finney and I
     have debated this a couple of times (first on the
     Extropians list, then a couple or more times on the
     Cypherpunks list), and we are mostly in agreement that this
     area is very promising and is deserving of much more
     thought--and even experimentation. (One of my interests in
     crypto simulations, in "protocol ecologies," is to simulate
     agents which play games involving reputations, spoofing,
     transfers of reputations, etc.)

                    + the trading firm which runs others people's money is
     probably less "reputable" in an important sense than the
     trading firm in which partners have their own personal
     fortunes riding....or at least I know which one I'd trust!
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - (But how to guarantee one isn't being fooled, by a spoof,
       a sham? Hard to say. Perhaps the "encrypted open books"
       protocol Eric Hughes is working on will be of use here.)
                        </li>

     limits choice, or insists on determining who can do

        <h5>
                15.8.1. "Are there any actual examples of software-mediated reputation systems?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - credit databases...positive and negative reputations
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                15.8.2. Absent laws which ban strong crypto (and such laws are themselves nearly unenforceable), it will be essentially impossible to stop anonymous transactions and purely reputation-based systems.
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - For example, Pr0duct Cypher and Sue D. Nym will be able to
     use private channels of their own choosing (possibly using
     anonymous pools, etc.) to communicate and arrange deals. If
     some form of digital cash exists, they will even be able to
     transfer this cash. (If not, barter of informations,
     whatever.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - So, the issues raised by Hal Finney and others, expressing
     doubts about the adequacy of reputation capital as a
     building block (and good concerns they are, by the way),
     become moot. Society cannot stop willing participants from
     using reputation and anonymity. This is a major theme of
     crypto anarchy: the bypassing of convention by willing
     participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    + If Alice and Bob don't care that their physical identies
     are unknown to each other, why should we care? That is, why
     should society step in and try to ban this arrangement?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - they won't be using "our" court systems, so that's not an
       issue (and longer term, PPLs will take the place of
       courts, many of us feel)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - only if Alice and Bob are counting on society, on third
       parties to the transaction, to do certain things, can
       society make a claim to be involved
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - (A main reason to try to ban anonymity will be to stop
       "bad" activities, which is a separate issue; banning of
       "bad" activity is usually pointless, and leads to
       repressive states. But I digress.)

                            - no silly rules that credit rating data can "only" go back
       some arbitrary number of years (7, in U.S.)...no silly
       rules about how certain bankruptcies "can't" be
       considered, how one's record is to be "cleared" if
       conditions are met, etc.

                        <li>
                            - rather, all data are considered....customer decides how
       to weight the data...(if a customer is too persnickety
       about past lapsed bills, or a bad debt many years in the
       past, he'll find himself never lending any money, so the
       "invisible hand" of the free market will tend to correct
       such overzealousnesses)

                16.3.1. "The revolution will not be televised. The revolution *will*, however, be digitized." Welcome to the New Underworld Order! (a term I have borrowed from writer Claire Sterling.)

        <h5>
                16.3.2. "Do the views here express the views of the Cypherpunks as a whole?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - This section is controversial. Hence, even more warnings
     than usual about being careful not to confuse these
     comments with the beliefs of all or even most Cypherpunks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - In fairness, libertarianism is undeniably the most
     represented ideology on the list, as it is in so much of
     the Net. The reasons for this have been extensively debated
     over the years, but it's a fact. If other major ideologies
     exists, they are fairly hidden on the Cypherpunks list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Yes, some quasi-socialist views are occasionally presented.
     My friend Dave Mandl, for example, has at times argued for
     a less-anarchocapitalist view (but I think our views are
     actually fairly similar...he just has a different language
     and thinks there's more of a difference than their actually
     is--insert smiley here).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - And several Cypherpunks who've thought about the issues of
     crypto anarchy have been disturbed by the conclusions that
     seem inevitable (markets for corporate information,
     assassianation made more liquid, data havens, espionage
     made much easier, and other such implications to be
     explored later in this section).

     example. The smashing of the national security state
     through digital espionage, information markets, and
     selective assassinations are not things that everyone will
     take comfort in. Some may even call it illegal, seditious,
     and dangerous. So be it.

       the laws on the books.

                            - Crypto anarchy is in a sense a throwback to the pre-state
       days of individual choice about which laws to follow. The
       community exerted  a strong force.

       terms), only an intrusive police state can stop people
       from accessing "illegal" sites, from communicating with
       others, from using "unapproved" services, and so on. To
       pick one example, the "credit data haven" that keeps any
       and all financial records--rent problems from 1975,
       bankruptcy proceedings from 1983, divorce settlements,
       results from private investigators, etc. In the U.S.,
       many such records are "unusable": can't use credit data
       older than 7 years (under the "Fair Credit Reporting
       Act"), PI data, etc. But if I am thinking about lending
       Joe Blow some money, how the hell can I be told I can't
       "consider" the fact that he declared bankruptcy in 1980,
       ran out on his debts in Haiti in 1989, and is being sued
       for all his assets by two ex-wives? The answer is simple:
       any law which says I am not allowed to take into account
       information which comes my way is _flawed_ and should be
       bypassed. Dialing in to a credit haven in Belize is one
       approach--except wiretaps might still get me caught.
       Cyberspace allows much more convenient and secure
       bypasses of these laws.

    <p>
        A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing- off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

       warring parties found that they could only have peace if
       they disowned omnipotent government.  They put together a
       peace agreement that in part proclaimed limits to
       government,  in part acknowledged inherent limits to what
       was proper for governments to do  and in part guaranteed
       that the government would not go beyond what it was
       proper for government to do, that the majority could not
       do as it pleased with the minority, that not any act of
       power was a law, that law was not merely whatever the
       government willed.
       
       They did not agree on a constitution but agreed to
       respect an unwritten constitution that already existed in
       some sense.
       
       A similar arrangement underlies the American constitution
       (now defunct) and the English declaration of right (also
       defunct)
       
       The problem with such formal peace agreements is that
       they can only be put together after government has
       substantially collapsed.  Some of us wish to try other
       possibilities in the event of collapse.

                    - Without false modesty, I think crypto anarchy is one of the
     few real contributions to ideology in recent memory. The
     notion of individuals becoming independent of states by
     bypassing ordinary channels of control is a new one. While
     there have been hints of this in the cyberpunk genre of
     writing, and related areas (the works of Vinge especially),
     the traditional libertarian and anarchist movements have
     mostly been oblivious to the ramifications of strong
     crypto.

                <li>
                    - Conventional political ideology has failed to realize the
     huge changes coming over the next several decades.
     Focussing on unwinnable battles at the ballot box, they
     fritter away their energies; they join the political
     process, but they have nothing to "deal" with, so they
     lose. The average American actually _wants_ to pick the
     pockets of his neighbors (to pay for "free" health care, to
     stop companies from laying-off unneeded workers, to bring
     more pork back to the local enonomy), so the average voter
     is highly unlikely to ever vote for a prinicpled
     Libertarian candidate.

        <h5>
                16.11.1. "How do you square these ideas with democracy?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - I don't; democracy has run amok, fulfilling de
     Tocqueville's prediction that American democracy would last
     only until Americans discovered they could pick the pockets
     of their neighbors at the ballot box
                </li>
                <li>
                    - little chance of changing public opinion, of educating them
                </li>
                <li>
                    - crypto anarchy is a movement of individual opting out, not
     of mass change and political action
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                16.11.2. "Is there a moral responsibility to ensure that the overall effects of crypto anarchy are more favorable than unfavorable before promoting it?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - I don't think so, any more than Thomas Jefferson should
     have analyzed the future implications of freedom before
     pushing it so strongly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - All decisions have implications. Some even cost lives. By
     not becoming a doctor working in Sub-Saharan Africa, have I
     "killed thousands"? Certainly I might have saved the lives
     of thousands of villagers. But I did not kill them just
     because I chose not to be a doctor. Likewise, by giving
     money to starving peasants in Bangladesh, lives could
     undeniably be "saved." But not giving the money does not
     murder them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - But such actions of omission are not the same, in my mind,
     as acts of comission. My freedom, via crypto anarchy, is
     not an act of force in and of itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Developing an idea is not the same as aggression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Crypto anarchy is about personal withdrawal from the
     system, the "technologies of disconnection," in Kevin
     Kelly's words.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - For many or even most of us, this has an easy answer, and
     is axiomatically true. But others have doubts, and more
     people may have doubts as some easily anticipated
     develpoments occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - (For example, pedophiles using the much-feared "fortress
     crypto," terrorists communicating in unbreakable codes, tza
     evaders, etc. Lots of examples.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - But because some people use crypto to do putatively evil
     things, should basic rights be given up? Closed doors can
     hide criminal acts, but we don't ban closed doors.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    - (Related to questions about group consensus, actions of the

                </li>
                <li>
                    - Indeed, there are dangers and risks. In the privacy of his
     home, my neighbor might be operating a torture dungeon for
     young children he captures. But absent real evidence of
     this, most nations have not sanctioned the random searches
     of private dwellings (not even in the U.S.S.R., so far as I
     know).

                </li>
                <li>
                    - It used to be that my answer was mostly a clear "No," with
     nuclear and biological weapons as the only clear exception.
     But recent events involving key escrow have caused me to
     rethink things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Imagine a company that's developing home surveillance
     cameras...perhaps for burglar prevention, child safety,
     etc. Parents can monitor Junior on ceiling-mounted cameras
     that can't easily be tampered with or disconnected, without
     sending out alarms. All well and good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Now imagine that hooks are put into these camera systems to
     send the captured images to a central office. Again, not
     necessarily a bad idea--vacationers may want their security
     company to monitor their houses, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The danger is that a repressive government could make the
     process mandatory....how else to catch sexual deviates,
     child molestors, marijuana growers, counterfeiters, and the
     like?
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Sound implausible, unacceptable, right? Well, key escrow is
     a form of this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The Danger. That OS vendors will put these SKE systems in
     place without adequate protections against key escrow being
     made mandatory at some future date.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                16.11.7. "Won't crypto anarchy allow some people to do bad things?"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Sure, so what else is new? Private rooms allows plotters to
     plot their plots. Etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Not to sound too glib, but most of the things we think of
     as basic rights allow various illegal, distasteful, or
     crummy things to go on. Part of the bargain we make.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "Of course you could prevent contract killings by requiring
     everyone to carry government "escrowed" tape recordings to
     record all their conversations and requiring them to keep a
     diary at all times alibing their all their activities.
     This would also make it much easier to stamp out child
     pornography, plutonium smuggling, and social discrimination
     against the politically correct." [James Donald, 1994-09-

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - What if potential criminals are allowed to have locks on
     their doors? What if potential rapists can buy pornography?
     What if....
                </li>
                <li>
                    - These are all straw men used in varous forms throughout
     history by tyrants to control their populations. The
     "sheepocracies" of the modern so-called democratic era are
     voting away their former freedoms in favor of cradle to
     grave safety and security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The latest tack is to propose limits on privacy to help
     catch criminals, pedophile, terrorists, and father rapers.
     God help us if this comes to pass. But Cypherpunks don't
     wait for God, they write code!

     off tens of thousands of the corrupt politicians, narcs,
     and cops which have implemented fascist, collectivist
     policies for so long. Assassination markets may make this
     much more practical.

                <li>
                    - However, things are already pretty bad. Look at Bosnia,
     Ruanda, and a hundred other hellholes and flashpoints
     around the world. Look at the nuclear arsenals of the
     superpowers, and look at who starts the wars. In nearly all
     cases, statism is to blame. States have killed a hundred
     million or more people in this century alone--think of
     Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot--through forced starvation
     of entire provinces, liquidation of the peasantry, killing
     of intellectuals, and mass exterminations of religious and
     ethnic groups. It's hard to imagine crypto anarchy causing
     anything that bad!
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Crypto anarchy is a cyberspatially-mediated personal course
     of action; by itself it involves no actions such as
     terrorism or nuclear blackmail. One could just as easily
     ask, "Will freedom lead to nuclear blackmail, weapons
     trading, and pedophilia?" The answer is the same: maybe,
     but so what?

     Calvinist-Randite reasons, but also because it would break
     the cycle of dependency which has actually made things
     worse for the underclass in America (at least). See Charles

     working overtime to try to keep up with the new
     possibilities crypto anarchy opens up. Untraceable cash, as
     in offshore bank accounts that one can send anonymous
     trading instructions to (or for), means insider trading

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - "...the availability of truly secure anonymity, strong
     encryption, and untraceable digital cash could allow
     contract killing to be an openly conducted business.  For
     example, an anonymous news post announces a public key
     which is to be used to encode a contract kill order, along
     with a digital cash payment.  The person placing the
     contract need only anonymously place the encrypted message
     in alt.test.  Perhaps it is even possible to make it
     impossible to tell that the message was encrypted with the
     contract killer's public key (the killer would have to
     attempt decryption of all similarly encoded messages on
     alt.test, but that might be quite feasible).  Thus it could
     be completely risk free for anyone to place a contract on
     anyone else." [Doug Cutrell, 1994-09-09]

                    - so they demand the civil law system enforce their rules
                </li>
                <li>
                    - practical example: sysadmins yank accounts when
     "inappropriate posts" are made
                </li>
                <li>
                    - the C&amp;S case of spamming is an example

                <li>
                    - Note: The Net as currently constituted is fraught with
     confusion about who owns what, about what are public and
     what are private resources, and about what things are
     allowed. If Joe Blow sends Suzy Creamcheese an "unwanted"
     letter, is this "abuse" or "harassement"? Is it stealing
     Suzy's resources? (In my opinion, of course not, but I
     agree that things are confusing.)

                    - "There are good engineering approaches which can force data
     to behave itself.  Many of them involve cryptography.  Our
     government's restrictions on crypto limit our ability to
     build reliable computer systems.  We need strong crypto for
     basic engineering reasons." [Kent Borg, "Arguing Crypto:

These private spaces will, as technology makes them more "livable" (I don't mean in a full sense, so don't send me notes about how "you can't eat cyberspace"), become full- functioned "spaces" that are outside the reach of governments. A new frontier, untouchable by outside, coercive governments.

                <li>
                    - Some people have objected to the sometimes over-
     enthusiastic claims that economies and socities will
     flourish in computer-mediated cyberspaces. The short form
     of the objection is: "You can't eat cyberspace." Meaning,
     that profits and gains made in cyberspace must be converted
     to real world profits and gains.

         work being done, the nature of the work, one's

         many consultants are hired "on retainer," merely to be

                    - One of the powerful uses of strong crypto is the creation
     of journals, web sites, mailing lists, etc., that are
     "untraceable." These are sometimes called "data havens,"
     though that term, as used by Bruce Sterling in "Islands in
     the Net" (1988), tends to suggest specific places like the
     Cayman Islands that corporations might use to store data. I
     prefer the emphasis on "cypherspace."

                <li>
                    - "It is worth noting that private "data havens" of all sorts
     abound, especially for financial matters, and most are not
     subject to governmental regulation....Some banks have
     research departments that are older and morecomprehensive
     than credit reporting agencies.  Favored customers can use
     them for evaluation of private deals....Large law firms
     maintain data banks that approach those of banks, and they
     grow with each case, through additions of private
     investigators paid for by successive clients....Security
     professionals, like Wackenhut and Kroll, also market the
     fruits of substantial data collections....To these add
     those of insurance, bonding, investment, financial firms
     and the like which help make or break business deals."

     and privacy. In fact, some of us support data havens
     precisely to have records of, say, terminal diseases so
     we'll not lend money to Joe-who-has-AIDS. It may not be
     "fair" to Joe, but it's my money. (Same idea as in using
     offshore or cryptospatial data havens to bypass the
     nonsense in the "Fair Credit Reporting Act" that outlaws
     the keeping of certain kinds of facts about credit
     applicants, such as that they declared bankruptcy 10 years
     ago or that they left a string of bad debts in Germany in
     the 1970s, etc.)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - On-line clearing has the possible danger implicit in all
     trades that Alice will hand over the money, Bob will verify
     that it has cleared into hisaccount (in older terms, Bob
     would await word that his Swiss bank account has just been
     credited), and then Bob will fail to complete his end of
     the bargain. If the transaction is truly anonymous, over
     computer lines, then of course Bob just hangs up his modem
     and the connection is broken. This situation is as old as
     time, and has always involved protcols in which trust,
     repeat business, etc., are factors. Or escrow agents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Long before the "key escrow" of Clipper, true escrow was
     planned. Escrow as in escrow agents. Or bonding agents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Alice and Bob want to conduct a transaction. Neither trusts
     the other;
     indeed, they are unknown to each other. In steps "Esther's
     Escrow Service." She is _also utraceable_, but has
     established a digitally-signed presence and a good
     reputation for fairness. Her business is in being an escrow
     agent, like a bonding agency, not in "burning" either
     party. (The math of this is interesting: as long as the
     profits to be gained from any small set of transactions is
     less than her "reputation capital," it is in her interest
     to forego the profits from burning and be honest. It is
     also possible to arrange that Esther cannot profit from
     burning either Alice or Bob or both of them, e.g., by
     suitably encrypting the escrowed stuff.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Alice can put her part of the transaction into escrow with
     Esther, Bob can do the same, and then Esther can release
     the items to the parties when conditions are met, when both
     parties agree, when adjudication of some sort occurs, etc.
     (There a dozen issues here, of course, about how disputes
     are settled, about how parties satisfy themselves that
     Esther has the items she says she has, etc.)

        <h5>
                16.24.3. Several people have raised the issue of someone in an anonymous transaction simply taking the money and not performing the service (or the flip side). This is where _intermediaries_ come into the picture, just as in the real worl (bonds, escrow agents, etc.).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                16.24.4. Alice and Bob wish to conduct an anonymous transaction; each is unknown to the other (no physical knowledge, no pseudonym reputation knowledge). These "mutually suspicious agents," in 1960s- and 70s-era computer science lingo, must arrange methods to conduct business while not trusting the other.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                16.24.5. Various cryptographic protocols have been developed for such things as "bit commitment" (useful in playing poker over the phone, for example). I don't know of progress made at the granularity of anonymous transactions, though. (Though the cryptographic protocol building blocks at lower levels--such as bit commitment and blobs--will presumably be used eventually at higher levels, in markets.)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                16.24.6. I believe there is evidence we can shorten the cycle by borrowing noncryptographic protocols (heresy to purists!) and adapting them. Reputations, for example. And escrow agents (a form of reputation, in that the "value" of a bonding entity or escrow agent lies in reputation capital).

                    - We don't know. Few things are certain. Only time will tell.

All crypto is economics, even information-theoretically secure crypto (e.g., bribe someone to give you the key, break in and steal it, etc.). And computationally-secure crypto-- such as RSA, IDEA, etc.--can in *principle* be brute-forced. In reality, the costs may well be exhorbitantly high...perhaps more energy than is available in the entire universe would be needed. Essentially, these things are about as unbreakable, untraceable, and unforgeable as one can imagine.)

                    - No, various parties will negotiate different arrangements.
     All a matter of economics, of enforcement of terms, etc.
     Some will, some won't. The key thing is that the decision
     to reveal identity will be just another mutually negotiated
     matter. (Think of spending cash in a store. The store owner
     may _want_ to know who his customers are, but he'll still
     take cash and remain ignorant in most cases. Unless a
     government steps in and distorts the market by requiring
     approvals for purchases and records of identities--think of
     guns here.)

                <li>
                    - For example, the local Mob may not lend me money if I am
     anonymous to them, but they have a "hook" in me if they
     know who I am. (Aspects of anonymity may still be used,
     such as systems that leave no paper or computer trail
     pointing to them or to me, to avoid stings.)

                <li>
                    - "Enforcement" in underground markets, for which the
     conventional legal remedies are impossible, is often by
     means of physical force: breaking legs and even killing
     welshers.

                <li>
                    - (Personally, I have no problems with this. The Mob cannot
     turn to the local police, so it has to enforce deals its
     own way. If you can't pay, don't play.)

     coming (nanotechnology being the usual place this is
     claimed, a la Vinge), but "phase changes" are more
     plausible. The effect of cheap printing was one such phase
     change, altering the connectivity of society and the
     dispersion of knowledge in a way that can best be described
     as a phase change. The effects of strong crypto, and the
     related ideas of digital cash, anonymous markets, etc., are
     likely to be similar.

                    - "...cryptography is not by any means a magic shield for

     not the case that someone who places an open anonymous
     contract for a murder in an open forum is doing so "risk
     free".  There are *plenty* of ways she might be found out.
     Likewise, big secret societies that nefariously undermine
     the free world via cryptography are as vulnerable as ever
     to the motivations of their own members to expose the
     groups in a double-cross." [Mike McNally, 1994-09-09]

     deviations. (This has been useful in avoiding modal
     software, where the same keystroke sequence might save a
     file in one program and erase it in another. Sadly, the
     complexity of modern software has outpaced the Mac OS
     system, so that Command-Option Y often does different

        <h5>
                17.3.1. "Why have most of the things Cypherpunks talk about *not* happened?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    + Except for remailers and basic crypto, few of the main
     ideas talked about for so long have actually seen any kind
     of realization. There are many reasons:
   A. Difficult to achieve. Both Karl Kleinpaste and Eric
       Hughes implemented simple first-generation remailers in a
       matter of _days_, but "digital cash" and "aptical
       foddering," for example, are not quite so
       straightforward. (I am of course not taking anything away
       from Kleinpaste, Hughes, Helsingius, Finney, etc., just
       noting that redirecting mail messages--and even
       implementing PGP and things like delay, batching, etc.,
       into remailers--is a lot easier conceptually than DC-Nets
       and the like.
   B. Protocols are confusing, tough to implement. Only a tiny
       fraction of the "crypto primitives" discussed at Crypto
       Conferences, or in the various crypto books, have been
       realized as runnable code. Building blocks like "bit
       commitment" have not even--to my knowledge--been
       adequately realized as reusable code. (Certainly various
       groups, such as Chaum's, have cobbled-together things
       like bit commitment....I just don't think there's a
       consensus as to the form, and this has limited the
       ability of nonspecialists to use these "objects.")
   C. Semantic confusion as well. While it's fairly clear what
       "encrypting" or "remailing" means, just what is a
       "digital bank"? Or a "reputation server"?
   D. Interoperablity is problematic. Many platforms, many
       operating systems, many languages. Again, remailers and
       encryption work because there is a de facto lowest common
       denominator for them: the simple text block, used in e-
       mail, editors, input and output from programs, etc. That
       is, we all mostly know exactly what an ASCII text block
       is, and crypto programs are expected to know how to
       access and manipulate such blocks. This largely explains
       the success of PGP across many platforms--text blocks are
       the basic element. Ditto for Cypherpunks remialers, which
       operate on the text blocks found in most mail systems.
       The situation becomes much murkier for things like
       digital money, which are not standalone objects and are
       often multi-party protocols involving time delays,
       offline processing, etc.
   E. Lack of an economic motive. We on this list are not being
       paid to develop anything, are not assisted by anyone, and

     anarchy. No staff, no dues, no elections, no official rules
     and regulations, and no leadership beyond what is provided
     by the power of speech (and a slight amount of "final say"

     of ways to protect yourself against the problems involved
     in dealing with anonymous entities in a situation in which
     there is no monopoly Government.....When one's PBX finds
     that one's call is not going through via a particular long
     distance carrier, it automatically switches to another one.
     It is easy to imagine one's intelligent agents testing
     various sorts of transaction completions and switching
     vendors when one fails. Professional checkers can supply
     information on vendor status for a fee. After all, we don't
     care if a company we are dealing with changes if its
     service is unaffected."  [Duncan Frissell, 1994-08-30]

     that unobvious?....One of the reasons I'm involved with the
     IETF IPSP effort is because the crypto stuff has to be
     transparent and ubiquitous before it is going to be truly
     useful -- in its current form its just junk. Hopefully,
     later versions of PGP will also interface well with the new
     standards being developed for an integrated secure message
     body type in MIME. (PGP also requires some sort of scalable
     and reverse mapable keyid system -- the current keyids are
     not going to allow key servers to scale in a distributed
     manner.) Yes, I've seen the shell scripts and the rest, and
     they really require too much effort for most people -- and
     at best, once you have things set up, you can now securely
     read some email at some sites. I know that for myself,
     given that I read a large fraction of my mail while working
     at clients, where I emphatically do not trust the hardware,
     every encrypted message means great inconvenience,
     regardless." [Perry Metzger, 1994-08-25]

     lowest in human history.  Communications costs are way
     down.  Electronics costs are way down.  We are in a zero or
     negative inflation environment.  The quantity and quality
     of  goods and services offered on the markets is at an all-
     time high.  The percentage of the world's countries headed
     by dictators is the lowest it's ever been.
     
     "What all this means is that political philosophies that
     depend on force of arms to push people into line,  will
     increasingly fail to work.  Rich people with choices will,
     when  coerced, tend to change their investments and
     business affairs into a friendlier form or to move to a
     friendlier  environment.  Choice is real.  If choices
     exist, they will be made.  An ever higher proportion of the
     world's people will be "rich" in wealth and choice as the
     years go on.

        <h5>
                18.5.1. "What about neural nets and AI in crypto?"
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Of limited use, at least in breaking modern ciphers. Marvin
     Minsky once said that if you don't understand how to solve
     a problem, adding randomness usually doesn't help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The shape of  the solution space is very spiky, very poorly-
     suited to hill-climbing or divide-and-conquer methods
                </li>
                <li>
                    + Neural nets are not likely to do well with modern ciphers
     (e.g., RSA, IDEA, DES, etc.), mainly because of the shape
     of the solution space.  Instead of the "rolling hills and
     valleys" that neural nets (and related methods, such as
     genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.) do well in,
     the solution space for modern ciphers offers very little in
     the way of "learning" opportunities: you either have the
     solution (the key), or you don't.
     
     Think of a needle standing up from a flat plain...a NN or
     any other hill-climber could wander for years and never
     find it. Well-designed modern ciphers like RSA and IDEA
     appear to admit no analysis based on "nonrandom"
     properties. If anybody has found shortcuts to factoring the
     modulus in RSA, for example, they haven't let on.
     
     I suspect there are uses in peripheral aspects, such as
     guessing passwords (when people have not picked high-
     entropy passwords, but have instead used familiar names).
     Or in traffic analysis. Those who munch on lots of traffic
     may well be using neural nets, custom signal processing,
     etc. to "prepare" the captured traffic for further
     analysis. A safe bet, in fact.
     
     But the move in modern cryptology is definitely away from
     using anything with "structure" that can be learned. Put
     another way, neural nets and such work well in structured
     environments, where there's something to _learn), but not
     in the high-entropy, seemingly random world of encrypted
     data.

                    - One of the great Unresolved Mysteries! Or the Holy Grail,

                </li>
                <li>
                    - The issue is why have provably hard (or NP-complete, to be
     more accurate) problems not been used? (Factoring is not
     known to NP-complete...experts can correct my phrasing here
     if I'm misstating things.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - It would be nice if a provably hard problem, such as the
     domino tiling problem, or 3SAT, or other such things out of
     Garey and Johnson's book on NP-Completeness could be used.
     This would increase confidence in ciphers still further.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Stephen Wolfram proposed use of cellular automata for
     crytography some years back; his collection of essays on
     cellular automata contains at least one such mention. Many
     people suspected that 1D CAs were no stronger than linear
     feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and I recally hearing a
     couple of years ago that someone proved 1D CAs (and maybe
     all CAs?) are equivalent to LFSRs, which have been used in
     crypto for many years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Wolfram's book is "Theory and Applications of Cellular
     Automata," 1986, World Scientific. Several papers on using
     CAs for random sequence generation. P. Bardell showed
     in1990 that CAs produce the outputs of LFSRs.) Wolfram also
     has a paper, "Cryptography with cellular automata," in
     Proc. CRYPTO 85.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Intuitively, the idea of a CA looks attractive for "one-way
     functions," for the reasons mentioned. But what's the
     "trapdoor" that gives the key holder a shortcut to reverse
     the process? (Public key crypto needs a trapdoor 1-way
     funtion that is easy to reverse if one has the right
     information).

                    - Somebody asked about this on sci.crypt and Vesselin
     Bontchev said:  "This topic has been debated to death in
     alt.security.pgp, when somebody posted KOH, without even a
     warning that it is a virus.....Both viruses indeed use the
     IDEA cipher - the same that is used both by SecureDevice
     and SecureDrive. However, the viruses pose some significant
     threats to the integrity of your data, exactly because of
     their viral replication means.....Also, if you aquire it by
     viral means, you do not get the doumentation and one
     utility, both of which are essential for the proper usage
     of the product - thus proving one more time that its viral
     capabilities are unnecessary and harmful. Also, the virus
     does not come in source, which means that it could have
     some hidden backdoors or simply security flaws, and you
     have no way to check this or to fix them. At last, in some
     cases the virus could destroy valuable information during
     its replication process."
                </li>
                <li>
                    - "In short - don't use them. You will gain nothing over
     using
     stand-alone encryption programs, and you'll expose your

     integrity to significant risks. Those viruses are
     completely useless
     and even harmful; they have been created with the only
     reason to
     condone the illicit activities of the virus writers, by
     claiming that
     computer viruses can be "useful"." [Vesselin Bontchev,

                <li>
                    - No direct link that any of us see clearly. Occasionally a

        <h5>
                18.17.1. In several places I've referred to "deep connections" between things like crypto, money, game theory, evolutionary ecologies, human motivations, and the nature of law. By this I mean that there are deeper, unifying principles. Principles involving locality, identity, and disclosure of knowledge. A good example: the deep fairness of "cut-and-choose" protocols- -I've seen mention of this in game theory tesxts, but not much discussion of other, similar protocols.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                18.17.2. For example, below the level of number theory and algorithms in cryptology lies a level dealing with "identity," "proof," "collusion," and other such core concepts, concepts that can almost be dealt with independent of the acual algorithms (though the concrete realization of public key methods took this out of the abstract realm of philosophy and made it important to analyze). And these abstract concepts are linked to other fields, such as economics, human psychology, law, and evolutionary game theory (the study of evolved strategies in multi-agent systems, e.g., human beings interacting and trading with each other).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                18.17.3. I believe there are important questions about why things work the way they do at this level. To be concrete, why do threats of physical coercion create market distortions and what effects does this have? Or, what is the nature of emergent behavior in reputation-based systems? (The combinatiion of crypto and economics is a fertile area, barely touched upon by the academic cryptology community.) Why is locality is important, and what does this mean for digital cash? Why does regulation often produce _more_ crime?
        </h5>

        <h5>
                18.17.4. Crypto and the related ideas of reputation, identity, and webs of trust has introduced a new angle into economic matters. I suspect there are a couple of Nobel Prizes in Economics for those who integrate these important concepts.

                                            - few consumers will have television sets with the
           resolution capabilities that even current computer
           monitors have (there are reasons for this: size of
           monitors (related to viewing distance), NTSC
           constraints, age of televisions, etc.)

                                            - Television is just one more switched-packet

           cables, etc. (to remove the objection about unsightly
           new poles or cables being strung...should not be an
           issue with fiber optics)

       standards, one hopes that antitrust laws will not be
       invoked.

                18.18.4. minor point: the importance of "But does it scale?" is often exaggerated

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - in many cases, it's much more important to simply get
     something deployed than it is to worry in advance about how
     it will break if too many people use it (e.g., MacDonald's
     worrying in 1955 about scalabilty of their business).
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Remailer networks, for example, may not scale especially
     well in their current form...but who cares? Getting them
     used will allow further refinement.

                    - Release Note: I regret that I haven't had time to add many
     new entries here. There are a lot of specialized terms, and
     I probably could have doubled the number of entries here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Much more work is needed here. In fact, I debated at one
     point making the FAQ instead into a kind of "Encycopedia
     Cypherpunkia," with a mix of short and long articles on
     each of hundreds of topics. Such an organization would
     suffer the disadvantages found in nearly all
     lexicographically-organized works: confusion of the
     concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Many of the these entries were compiled for a long handout
     at the first Cypherpunks meeting, September, 1992. Errors
     are obviously present. I'll try to keep correcting them
     when I can.

        <h5>
                19.4.17. cipher -- a secret form of writing, using substitution or transposition of characters or symbols. (From Arabic "sifr," meaning "nothing.")

        <h5>
                19.4.21. coin flippping -- an important crypto primitive, or protocol, in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is possible. Implemented with blobs.

        <h5>
                19.4.22. collusion -- wherein several participants cooperate to deduce the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a cipher. Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of collusion. Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for example, involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate message senders and thereby trace origins and destinations of mail.

        <h5>
                19.4.32. cyberspace -- the electronic domain, the Nets, and computer- generated spaces. Some say it is the "consensual reality" described in "Neuromancer." Others say it is the phone system. Others have work to do.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.33. DC protocol, or DC-Net -- the dining cryptographers protocol. DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating with the DC protocol.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.34. DES -- the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in 1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with assistance from the National Security Agency. Based on the "Lucifer" cipher developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a secret key cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data through multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling the routing. "Diffusion" and "confusion" are combined to form a cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see "DES, Security of"). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a cipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available for PCs.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.35. DES, Security of -- many have speculated that the NSA placed a trapdoor (or backdoor) in DES to allow it to read DES- encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is known that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key and that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits plus 8 parity bits), ths making exhaustive search much easier (so far as is known, brute-force search has not been done, though it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan have used a technique called "differential cryptanalysis" to reduce the exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext attacks (but with no import for ordinary DES).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.36. differential cryptanalysis -- the Shamir-Biham technique for cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext attack, they've reduced the number of DES keys that must be tried from about 2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, that rarely can an attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack on DES systems.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.37. digital cash, digital money -- Protocols for transferring value, monetary or otherwise, electronically. Digital cash usually refers to systems that are anonymous. Digital money systems can be used to implement any quantity that is conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc. There are many variations of digital money systems, ranging from VISA numbers to blinded signed digital coins. A topic too large for a single glossary entry.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.38. digital pseudonym -- basically, a "crypto identity." A way for individuals to set up accounts with various organizations without revealing more information than they wish. Users may have several digital pseudonyms, some used only once, some used over the course of many years. Ideally, the pseudonyms can be linked only at the will of the holder. In the simplest form, a public key can serve as a digital pseudonym and need not be linked to a physical identity.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.39. digital signature -- Analogous to a written signature on a document. A modification to a message that only the signer can make but that everyone can recognize. Can be used legally to contract at a distance.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.40. digital timestamping -- one function of a digital notary public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab notebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot (easily) be forged.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.41. dining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, DC nets) -- the untraceable message sending system invented by David Chaum. Named after the "dining philosophers" problem in computer science, participants form circuits and pass messages in such a way that the origin cannot be deduced, barring collusion. At the simplest level, two participants share a key between them. One of them sends some actual message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the message with the key, while the other one just sends the key itself. The actual message from this pair of participants is obtained by XORing the two outputs. However, since nobody but the pair knows the original key, the actual message cannot be traced to either one of the participants.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.42. discrete logarithm problem -- given integers a, n, and x, find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m exists. Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is straightforward (and special purpose chips are available), but the inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in general. Thus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation is a one-way function.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.43. DSS, Digital Signature Standard -- the latest NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to NBS) standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal cipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA- based signature schemes.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.44. eavesdropping, or passive wiretapping -- intercepting messages without detection. Radio waves may be intercepted, phone lines may be tapped, and computers may have RF emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be tapped.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.45. Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) -- current name for the key escrow system known variously as Clipper, Capstone, Skipjack, etc.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.46. factoring -- Some large numbers are difficult to factor. It is conjectured that there are no feasible--i.e."easy," less than exponential in size of number-- factoring methods. It is also an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily than by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might reveal information which simplifies the problem). Interestingly, though factoring is believed to be "hard", it is not known to be in the class of NP-hard problems. Professor Janek invented a factoring device, but he is believed to be fictional.

        <h5>
                19.4.48. information-theoretic security -- "unbreakable" security, in which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a cipher or system. One time pads are an example (providing the pads are not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of course). Same as unconditionally secure.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.49. key -- a piece of information needed to encipher or decipher a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., just as with physical keys.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.50. key exchange, or key distribution -- the process of sharing a key with some other party, in the case of symmetric ciphers, or of distributing a public key in an asymmetric cipher. A major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably and without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such scheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.51. known-plaintext attack -- a cryptanalysis of a cipher where plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack searches for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen plaintext attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the plaintext to be enciphered.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.52. listening posts -- the NSA and other intelligence agencies maintain sites for the interception of radio, telephone, and satellite communications. And so on. Many sites have been identified (cf. Bamford), and many more sites are suspected.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.53. mail, untraceable -- a system for sending and receiving mail without traceability or observability. Receiving mail anonymously can be done with broadcast of the mail in encrypted form. Only the intended recipient (whose identity, or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may able to decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously apparently requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers (DC) protocol.

        <h5>
                19.4.55. minimum disclosure proofs -- another name for zero knowledge proofs, favored by Chaum.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.56. mixes -- David Chaum's term for a box which performs the function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and outgoing electronic mail messages. The box also strips off the outer envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and remails the message to the address on the inner envelope. Tamper- resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating and forced disclosure of the mapping between incoming and outgoing mail. A sequence of many remailings effectively makes tracing sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this with the software version, the DC protocol. The "remailers" developed by Cypherpunks are an approximation of a Chaumian mix.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.57. modular exponentiation -- raising an integer to the power of another integer, modulo some integer. For integers a, n, and m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular exponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of bit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been designed. See also discrete logarithm.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.58. National Security Agency (NSA) -- the largest intelligence agency, responsible for making and breaking ciphers, for intercepting communications, and for ensuring the security of U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, with many listening posts around the world. The NSA funds cryptographic research and advises other agencies about cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the world's leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the case.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.59. negative credential -- a credential that you possess that you don't want any one else to know, for example, a bankruptcy filing. A formal version of a negative reputation.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.60. NP-complete -- a large class of difficult problems. "NP" stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of problems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms for their solution. A problem is "complete" if any other NP problem may be reduced to that problem. Many important combinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the travelling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem, the graph isomorphism problem, the word problem, and on and on.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.61. oblivious transfer -- a cryptographic primitive that involves the probablistic transmission of bits. The sender does not know if the bits were received.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.62. one-time pad -- a string of randomly-selected bits or symbols which is combined with a plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. This combination may be shifting letters some amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The recipient, who also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily recover the plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and then destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the system is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information- theoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad) is obviously a practical concern, but consider CD-ROM's.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.63. one-way function -- a function which is easy to compute in one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. modular exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known as the discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case of trap door one-way functions. An example of a one-way operation is multiplication: it is easy to multiply two prime numbers of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, but hard to factor that 200-digit number.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.64. P ?=? NP -- Certainly the most important unsolved problem in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as we know it today does not exist. If P = NP, all NP problems are "easy."
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.65. padding -- sending extra messages to confuse eavesdroppers and to defeat traffic analysis. Also adding random bits to a message to be enciphered.

        <h5>
                19.4.69. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) -- Phillip Zimmerman's implementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, with more robust components and several new features. RSA Data Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it. Version 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.70. prime numbers -- integers with no factors other than themselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded. About 1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime. Since there are about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about 10^23 100 digit primes for each and every particle in the universe!
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.71. probabalistic encryption -- a scheme by Goldwasser, Micali, and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the same plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many ciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects against certain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.72. proofs of identity -- proving who you are, either your true name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of the right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work has been done on "is-a-person" credentialling agencies, using the so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol...think of this as a way to issue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of identity may be done with biometric security methods. Zero knowledge proofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact that the identity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for computer access, passwords, etc.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.73. protocol -- a formal procedure for solving some problem. Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of protocols for many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit commitment (blobs), zero knowledge proofs, dining cryptographers, and so on.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.74. public key -- the key distributed publicly to potential message-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like directory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity of this public key to guard against spoofing or impersonation.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.75. public key cryptosystem -- the modern breakthrough in cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with contributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way functions so that encryption may be done by anyone with access to the "public key" but decryption may be done only by the holder of the "private key." Encompasses public key encryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other protocols and applications.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.76. public key encryption -- the use of modern cryptologic methods to provided message security and authentication. The RSA algorithm is the most widely used form of public key encryption, although other systems exist. A public key may be freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like directories, while the corresponding private key is closely guarded.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.77. public key patents -- M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the work of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, formed Public Key Partners to license the various public key, digital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in the early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP has licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, which handles the sales, etc.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.78. quantum cryptography -- a system based on quantum-mechanical principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state of the system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and Bennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been made.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.79. remailers -- software versions of Chaum's "mixes," for the sending of untraceable mail. Various features are needed to do this: randomized order of resending, encryption at each stage (picked in advance by the sender, knowing the chain of remailers), padding of message sizes. The first remailer was written by E. Hughes in perl, and about a dozen or so are active now, with varying feature sets.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.80. reputations -- the trail of positive and negative associations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit ratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all examples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation credentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In crypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of paramount importance. There are many fascinating issues of how reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be bought and sold, and so forth.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.81. RSA -- the main public key encryption algorithm, developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It exploits the difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a private key and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains the core of modern public key systems. It is usually much slower than DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation chips will likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to use RSA to transmit session keys and then a high-speed cipher like DES for the actual message text.

                <li>
                    - Description -- Let p and q be large primes, typically with
     more than 100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that
     e is relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers
     p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The set of numbers
     n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not
     sufficient to easily find p and q...the factoring problem).
     A message M is encrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner
     of the private key can decrypt the encrypted message by
     exploiting number theory results, as follows. An integer d
     is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). Euler
     proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n
     = M. This means that in some sense the integers e and d are
     "inverses" of each other. [If this is unclear, please see
     one of the many texts and articles on public key
     encryption.]

        <h5>
                19.4.84. smart cards -- a computer chip embedded in credit card. They can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, etc. Usually these are built with some degree of tamper-resistance. Smart cards may perform part of a crypto transaction, or all of it. Performing part of it may mean checking the computations of a more powerful computer, e.g., one in an ATM.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.85. spoofing, or masquerading -- posing as another user. Used for stealing passwords, modifying files, and stealing cash. Digital signatures and other authentication methods are useful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and protected to ensure that others don't subsititute their own public keys which users may then unwittingly use.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.86. steganography -- a part of cryptology dealing with hiding messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving messages. Message traffic is often padded to reduce the signals that would otherwise come from a sudden beginning of messages. "Covered writing."

        <h5>
                19.4.88. tamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant modules (TRMs) -- sealed boxes or modules which are hard to open, requiring extensive probing and usually leaving ample evidence that the tampering has occurred. Various protective techniques are used, such as special metal or oxide layers on chips, armored coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other measures to thwart analysis. Popularly called "tamper-proof boxes." Uses include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators, cryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.

        <h5>
                19.4.89. tampering, or active wiretapping -- intefering with messages and possibly modifying them. This may compromise data security, help to break ciphers, etc. See also spoofing.

                19.4.92. traffic analysis -- determining who is sending or receiving messages by analyzing packets, frequency of packets, etc. A part of steganography. Usually handled with traffic padding.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.93. traffic analysis -- identifying characteristics of a message (such as sender, or destination) by watching traffic. Remailers and encryption help to foil traffic analysys.

        <h5>
                19.4.95. trap messages -- dummy messages in DC Nets which are used to catch jammers and disrupters. The messages contain no private information and are published in a blob beforehand so that the trap message can later be opened to reveal the disrupter. (There are many strategies to explore here.)
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.96. trap-door -- In cryptography, a piece of secret information that allows the holder of a private key to invert a normally hard to invert function.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.4.97. trap-door one way functions -- functions which are easy to compute in both the forward and reverse direction but for which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the function in the forward direction does not provide information on how to compute the function in the reverse direction. More simply put, trap-door one way functions are one way for all but the holder of the secret information. The RSA algorithm is the best-known example of such a function.

Peggy the Prover demonstrates to Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in possession of some piece of knowledge without actually revealing any of that knowledge. This is useful for access to computers, because eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot steal the knowledge given. Also called minimum disclosure proofs.

       better-featured, has a Windows interface, is a device

       currently does not ship with source code and uses a more

       &gt;
       &gt;PGP 2.6 is distributed from MIT and is legally available
       to US and Canadian
       &gt;residents. It uses the RSAREF library. It has code that
       will prevent
       &gt;interoperation with earlier versions of PGP.
       &gt;
       &gt;PGP 2.6ui is a modified version of PGP 2.3a which
       functions almost
       &gt;identically to MIT PGP 2.6, without the "cripple code"
       of MIT PGP 2.6. It
       &gt;is legally available outside the US and Canada only.
       
       This is false.  PGP 2.6ui is available to US and Canadian
       residents.
       It is definitely legal for such people to download PGP
       2.6ui and study
       it.
       
       However, RSADSI claim that *using* PGP 2.6ui in the US
       and Canada
       violates their patents on the RSA algorithm and on public
       key
       cryptography in general.  Other people (like myself)
       believe that
       these patents wouldn't stand up if tested in court, and
       that in any
       case the damages recoverable would be zero.
       
       You might also like to know that the output formats
       generated by 2.6ui
       and MIT-2.6 are identical, so that if you choose to use
       2.6ui in North
       America noone will be able to tell the difference anyway.
       
       Unfortunately these patent problems have caused many
       North American
       FTP sites to stop carrying 2.3a and 2.6ui, for fear of
       committing
       contributory infringement.
       
       If you would like to examine PGP 2.3a or 2.6ui, they are
       available on
       many FTP sites.  Try
        black.ox.ac.uk:/src/security
        ftp.demon.co.uk:/pub/pgp
        ftp.dsi.unimi.it:/pub/security/crypt/PGP
        ftp.funet.fi:/pub/crypt
       for starters.  Look out for the regular postings here in
       alt.security.pgp for other sites.

        <h5>
                19.8.1. I regret that I can't be complete in all versions, platforms supported, sites for obtaining, instructions, incompatibilities, etc. Frankly, I'm drowning in reports of new versions, questions about use, etc. Most of these versions I have no direct knowledge of, have no experience with, and no appreciation of subtle incompatibilites involved.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                19.8.2. There are others who have concentrated on providing up-to- date reports on what is available. Some of them are"

        <h5>
                19.8.3. Reading sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp, and related groups for a few weeks and looking for programs of interest to one's own situation should give the most recent and current results. Things are moving quickly, so if one is interested in "AmigaPGP," for example, then the right place to look for the latest versions is in the groups just mentioned, or in groups and ftp sites specific to the Amiga. (Be careful that sabotaged or spoofed versions are not used, as in all crypto. "Joe's AmigaPGP" might need a closer look.)

                20.2.2. Apologies in advance for the mix of styles (outline, bullet, text, essays), for fragments and incomplete sections.

Go with the flow, use your text searching tools, and deal with it.

    <h4>
        20.3. Copyright Comments
    </h4>


        <h5>
                20.3.1. It may seem illogical for a Cypherpunk to assert some kind of copyright. Perhaps. But my main concern is the ease with which people can relabel documents as their own, sometimes after only adding a few words here and there.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.3.2. Yes, I used the words of others in places, to make points better than I felt my own words would, to save time, and to give readers a different voice speaking on issues. I have credited quotes with a "[Joe Foobar, place, date] attribution, usually at the end of the quote. If a place is not listed, it is the Cypherpunks list itself. The author and date should be sufficient to (someday) retrieve the source text. By the way, I used quotes as they seemed appropriate, and make no claims that the quoted points are necessarily original to the author--who may have remembered them from somewhere else--or that the date listed is the origination date for the point. I have something like 80 megabytes of Cypherpunks posts, so I couldn't do an archaeological dig for the earliest mention of an idea.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.3.3. People can quote this FAQ under the "fair use" provisions, e.g., a paragraph or two, with credits. Anything more than a few paragraphs constitutes copyright infringement, as I understand it.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.3.4. Should I give up the maintaining of this FAQ and/or should others get involved, then the normal co-authorship and inheritance arrangements will be possible.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.3.5. The Web. WWW and Mosaic offer amazing new opportunities for on-line documents. It is in fact likely that this FAQ will be available as a Web document. My concern, however, is that the integrity and authorship be maintained. Thus, splitting the document in a hundred or more little pieces, with no authorship attached, would not be cool. Also, I intend to maintain this document with my powerful outlining tools (Symantec's "MORE," on a Macintosh) and thus anyone who "freezes" the document and uses it as a base for links, pointers, etc., will be left behind as mods are made.

    <h4>
        20.4. A Few Words on the Style
    </h4>


        <h5>
                20.4.1. Some sections are in outline form
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - like this
                </li>
                <li>
                    - with fragments of ideas and points
                </li>
                <li>
                    - with incomplete sentences
                </li>
                <li>
                    - and with lists of points that are obviously only starting
     points for more complete analyses
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                20.4.2. Other sections are written in more complete essay form, as reasonably self-contained analyses of some point or topic. Like this. Some of these essays were taken directly out of posts I did for the list, or for sci.crypt, and no attribution H (since I wrote the stuff...quotes from others are credited).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.4.3. The styles may clash, but I just don't have the hundreds of hours to go through and "regularize" everything to a consistent style. The outline style allows additional points, wrinkles, rebuttals, and elaborations to be grafted on easily (if not always elegantly). I hope most readers can understand this and learn to deal with it.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.4.4. Of course, there are places where the points made are just too fragmentary, too outlinish, for people to make sense of. I've tried to clean these up as much as I can, but there will always be some places where an idea seemed clear to me at the time (maybe not) but which is not presented clearly to others. I'll keep trying to iron these kinks out in future versions.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.4.5. Comment on style
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - In many cases I merged two or more chunks of ideas into one
     section, resulting in many cases in mismatching writing
     styles, tenses, etc. I apologize, but I just don't have the
     many dozens of hours it might take to go through and
     "regularize" things, to write more graceful transition
     paragraphs, etc. I felt it was more important to get the
     ideas and idea fragments out than to polish the writing.
     (Essays written from scratch, and in order, are generally
     more graceful than are concatenations of ideas, facts,
     pointers, and the like.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Readers should also not assume that a "fleshed-out"
     section, made up of relatively complete paragraphs, is any
     more important than a section that is still mostly made up
     of short one-liners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - References to Crypto Journals, Books. Nearly every section
     in this document _could have_ one or more references to
     articles and papers in the Crypto Proceedings, in
     Schneier's book, or whatever. Sorry, but I can't do this.
     Maybe someday--when true hypertext arrives and is readily
     usable (don't send me e-mail about HTML, or Xanadu, etc.)
     this kind of cross-referencing will be done. Footnotes
     would work today, but are distracting in on-line documents.
     And too much work, given that this is not meant to be a
     scholarly thesis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - I also have resisted the impulse to included quotes or
     sections from other FAQs, notably the sci.crypt and rsadsi
     FAQs. No point in copying their stuff, even with
     appropriate credit. Readers should already have these docs,
     of course.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>
                20.4.6. quibbling
        </h5>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Any time you say something to 500-700 people, expect to
     have a bunch of quibbles. People will take issue with
     phrasings, with choices of definitions, with facts, etc.
     Correctness is important, but sometimes the quibbling sets
     off a chain reaction of corrections, countercorrections,
     rebuttals, and "I would have put it differently"s. It's all
     a bit overwhelming at times. My hope for this FAQ is that
     serious errors are (of course) corrected, but that the List
     not get bogged down in endless quibbling about such minor
     issues as style and phrasing.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h4>
        20.5. How to Find Information
    </h4>


        <h5>
                20.5.1. This FAQ is very long, which makes finding specific questions problematic. Such is life--shorter FAQ are of course easier to navigate, but may not address important issues.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.5.2. A full version of this FAQ is available, as well as chapter- by-chapter versions (to reduce the downloading efforts for some people). Search tools within text editors are one way to find topics. Future versions of this FAQ may be paginated and then indexed (but maybe not).
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.5.3. I advise using search tools in editors and word processors to find sections of interest. This is likely faster anyway than consulting an index generated by me (which I haven't generated, and probably never will).
        </h5>

    <h4>
        20.6. My Views
    </h4>


        <h5>
                20.6.1. This FAQ, or whatever one calls it, is more than just a simple listing of frequently asked questions and the lowest- common-denominator answers. This should be clear just by the size alone. I make no apologies for writing the document I wanted to write. Others are free to write the FAQ they would prefer to read. You're getting what you paid for.
        </h5>

        <h5>
                20.6.2. My views are rather strong in some areas. I've tried to present some dissenting arguments in cases where I think Cypherpunks are really somewhat divided, such as in remailer strategies and the like. In cases where I think there's no credible dissent, such as in the wisdom of Clipper, I've made no attempt to be fair. My libertarian, even anarchist, views surely come through. Either deal with it, or don't read the document. I have to be honest about this.
        </h5>

    <h4>
        20.7. More detailed disclaimer
    </h4>


        <h5>
                20.7.1. This detailed disclaimer is probably not good in most courts in the U.S., contracts having been thrown out if favor of nominalism, but here it is anyway. At least nobody can claim they were misled into thinking I was giving them warranteed, guaranteed advice.

Certain ideas are explored which, if implemented, would be illegal to various extents in most countries in the world. Think of these explorations of ideas as just that.
